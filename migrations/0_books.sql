Questa verità è cosí radicata nella mente delle famiglie del luoho che, nel momento in cui un simile personaggio viene a far parte del vicinato, prima ancora di conoscere anche lontanamente i suoi desiderî in proposito, viene immediatamente considerato come proprietà legittima di una o l''altra delle loro figlie.»Orgoglio e pregiudizio è uno dei primi romanzi di Jane Austen. La scrittrice lo iniziò a ventun anni; il libro, rifiutato da un editore londinese, rimase in un cassetto fino alla sua pubblicazione anonima nel 1813, e da allora è considerato tra i piú importanti romanzi della letteratura inglese. È la storia delle cinque sorelle Bennet e dei loro corteggiatori, con al centro il romantico contrasto tra l''adorabile e capricciosa Elizabeth e l''altezzoso Darcy; lo spirito di osservazione implacabile e quasi cinico, lo studio arguto dei caratteri, la satira delle vanità e delle debolezze della vita domestica, fanno di questo romanzo una delle piú efficaci e indimenticabili commedie di costume del periodo Regency inglese.','Modern Library Classics, USA / CAN','Paperback','9.78068E+12',279,4.25,2453620,'Pride and Prejudice','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320399351l/1885.jpg','b0003',20.56),

    ('In Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare creates a world of violence and generational conflict in which two young people fall in love and die because of that love. The story is rather extraordinary in that the normal problems faced by young lovers are here so very large. It is not simply that the families of Romeo and Juliet disapprove of the lover''s affection for each other; rather, the Montagues and the Capulets are on opposite sides in a blood feud and are trying to kill each other on the streets of Verona. Every time a member of one of the two families dies in the fight, his relatives demand the blood of his killer. Because of the feud, if Romeo is discovered with Juliet by her family, he will be killed. Once Romeo is banished, the only way that Juliet can avoid being married to someone else is to take a potion that apparently kills her, so that she is burried with the bodies of her slain relatives. In this violent, death-filled world, the movement of the story from love at first sight to the union of the lovers in death seems almost inevitable.What is so striking about this play is that despite its extraordinary setting (one perhaps reflecting Elizabethan attitudes about hot-blooded Italians), it has become the quintessential story of young love. Because most young lovers feel that they have to overcome giant obstacles in order to be together, because they feel that they would rather die than be kept apart, and especially because the language Shakespeare gives his young lovers is so exquisite, allowing them to say to each other just what we would all say to a lover if we only knew how, it is easy to respond to this play as if it were about all young lovers rather than about a particular couple in a very unusual world. (When the play was rewritten in the eighteen century as The History and Fall of Caius Marius, the violent setting became that of a particularly discordant period in classical Rome; when Leonard Berstein rewrote the play as West Side Story, he chose the violent world of New York street gangs.)','New Folger edition','Mass Market Paperback','9.78074E+12',283,3.74,1818262,'Romeo and Juliet','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327872146l/18135.jpg','b0011',26.31),

The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender''s two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military''s purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine''s abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails.Source: hatrack.com','Author''s Definitive Edition, Revised mass market edition  (US / CAN)','Mass Market Paperback','9.78081E+12',324,4.3,965351,'Ender''s Game','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1408303130l/375802.jpg','b0014',12.07),

In Oran, a coastal town in North Africa, the plague begins as a series of portents, unheeded by the people. It gradually becomes a omnipresent reality, obliterating all traces of the past and driving its victims to almost unearthly extremes of suffering, madness, and compassion.','First Vintage International Edition','Paperback','9.78068E+12',308,3.98,124415,'The Plague','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1503362434l/11989.jpg','b0118',33.87),
    ('Sophisticated, witty, and ingeniously convincing, Susanna Clarke''s magisterial novel weaves magic into a flawlessly detailed vision of historical England. She has created a world so thoroughly enchanting that eight hundred pages leave readers longing for more.English magicians were once the wonder of the known world, with fairy servants at their beck and call; they could command winds, mountains, and woods. But by the early 1800s they have long since lost the ability to perform magic. They can only write long, dull papers about it, while fairy servants are nothing but a fading memory.But at Hurtfew Abbey in Yorkshire, the rich, reclusive Mr Norrell has assembled a wonderful library of lost and forgotten books from England''s magical past and regained some of the powers of England''s magicians. He goes to London and raises a beautiful young woman from the dead. Soon he is lending his help to the government in the war against Napoleon Bonaparte, creating ghostly fleets of rain-ships to confuse and alarm the French.All goes well until a rival magician appears. Jonathan Strange is handsome, charming, and talkative-the very opposite of Mr Norrell. Strange thinks nothing of enduring the rigors of campaigning with Wellington''s army and doing magic on battlefields. Astonished to find another practicing magician, Mr Norrell accepts Strange as a pupil. But it soon becomes clear that their ideas of what English magic ought to be are very different. For Mr Norrell, their power is something to be cautiously controlled, while Jonathan Strange will always be attracted to the wildest, most perilous forms of magic. He becomes fascinated by the ancient, shadowy figure of the Raven King, a child taken by fairies who became king of both England and Faerie, and the most legendary magician of all. Eventually Strange''s heedless pursuit of long-forgotten magic threatens to destroy not only his partnership with Norrell, but everything that he holds dear.','First Tor Edition','Paperback','9.78077E+12',1006,3.81,170252,'Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1357027589l/14201.jpg','b0119',15.94),

    ('In his journal, Nobel Prize winner John Steinbeck called East of Eden “the first book,” and indeed it has the primordial power and simplicity of myth. Set in the rich farmland of California’s Salinas Valley, this sprawling and often brutal novel follows the intertwined destinies of two families—the Trasks and the Hamiltons—whose generations helplessly reenact the fall of Adam and Eve and the poisonous rivalry of Cain and Abel.Adam Trask came to California from the East to farm and raise his family on the new rich land. But the birth of his twins, Cal and Aaron, brings his wife to the brink of madness, and Adam is left alone to raise his boys to manhood. One boy thrives nurtured by the love of all those around him; the other grows up in loneliness enveloped by a mysterious darkness.First published in 1952, East of Eden is the work in which Steinbeck created his most mesmerizing characters and explored his most enduring themes: the mystery of identity, the enecplicability of love, and the murderous consequences of love''s absence. A masterpiece of Steinbeck''s later years, East of Eden is a powerful and vastly ambitious novel that is at once a family saga and a modern retelling of the Book of Genesis.--jacket flap','Steinbeck Centennial Edition (US / CAN)','Paperback','9.78014E+12',601,4.36,367472,'East of Eden','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1441547516l/4406.jpg','b0122',21.29),

    ('Erik Larson''s gifts as a storyteller are magnificently displayed in this rich narrative of the master builder, the killer, and the great fair that obsessed them both.Two men, each handsome and unusually adept at his chosen work, embodied an element of the great dynamic that characterized America''s rush toward the twentieth century. The architect was Daniel Hudson Burnham, the fair''s brilliant director of works and the builder of many of the country''s most important structures, including the Flatiron Building in New York and Union Station in Washington, D.C. The murderer was Henry H. Holmes, a young doctor who, in a malign parody of the White City, built his "World''s Fair Hotel" just west of the fairgrounds—a torture palace complete with dissection table, gas chamber, and 3,000-degree crematorium. Burnham overcame tremendous obstacles and tragedies as he organized the talents of Frederick Law Olmsted, Charles McKim, Louis Sullivan, and others to transform swampy Jackson Park into the White City, while Holmes used the attraction of the great fair and his own satanic charms to lure scores of young women to their deaths. What makes the story all the more chilling is that Holmes really lived, walking the grounds of that dream city by the lake.The Devil in the White City draws the reader into a time of magic and majesty, made all the more appealing by a supporting cast of real-life characters, including Buffalo Bill, Theodore Dreiser, Susan B.

    ('The Pulitzer Prize-winning epic of the Great Depression, a book that galvanized—and sometimes outraged—millions of readers.First published in 1939, Steinbeck’s Pulitzer Prize-winning epic of the Great Depression chronicles the Dust Bowl migration of the 1930s and tells the story of one Oklahoma farm family, the Joads—driven from their homestead and forced to travel west to the promised land of California. Out of their trials and their repeated collisions against the hard realities of an America divided into Haves and Have-Nots evolves a drama that is intensely human yet majestic in its scale and moral vision, elemental yet plainspoken, tragic but ultimately stirring in its human dignity. A portrait of the conflict between the powerful and the powerless, of one man’s fierce reaction to injustice, and of one woman’s stoical strength, the novel captures the horrors of the Great Depression and probes into the very nature of equality and justice in America. At once a naturalistic epic, captivity narrative, road novel, and transcendental gospel, Steinbeck’s powerful landmark novel is perhaps the most American of American Classics.','75th Anniversary Edition','Hardcover','9.78067E+12',479,3.94,617033,'The Grapes of Wrath','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1513108059l/18114322.jpg','b0147',21.65),

    ('The Book of Mormon is a volume of scripture comparable to the Bible. It is a record of God''s dealings with the ancient inhabitants of the Americas and contains, as does the Bible, the fullness of the everlasting gospel.The book was written by many ancient prophets by the spirit of prophecy and revelation. Their words, written on gold plates, were quoted and abridged by a prophet-historian named Mormon. The record gives an account of two great civilizations. One came from Jerusalem in 600 B.C., and afterward separated into two nations, known as the Nephites and the Lamanites. The other came much earlier when the Lord confounded the tongues at the Tower of Babel. This group is known as the Jaredites. After thousands of years, all were destroyed except the Lamanites, and they are among the ancestors of the American Indians. The crowning event recorded in the Book of Mormon is the personal ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ among the Nephites soon after his resurrection. It puts forth the doctrines of the gospel, outlines the plan of salvation, and tells men what they must do to gain peace in this life and eternal salvation in the life to come. After Mormon completed his writings, he delivered the account to his son Moroni, who added a few words of his own and hid up the plates in the hill Cumorah. On September 21, 1823, the same Moroni, then a glorified, resurrected being, appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith and instructed him relative to the ancient record and its destined translation into the English language. In due course the plates were delivered to Joseph Smith, who translated them by the gift and power of God. The record is now published in many languages as a new and additional witness that Jesus Christ is the Son of the living God and that all who will come unto him and obey the laws and ordinances of his gospel may be saved. Concerning this record the Prophet Joseph Smith said: "I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book." In addition to Joseph Smith, the Lord provided for eleven others to see the gold plates for themselves and to be special witnesses of the truth and divinity of the Book of Mormon.

    ('Which is more dangerous, a gun or a swimming pool? What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common? Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? How much do parents really matter? What kind of impact did Roe v. Wade have on violent crime? Freakonomics will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.These may not sound like typical questions for an economist to ask. But Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He is a much heralded scholar who studies the stuff and riddles of everyday life -- from cheating and crime to sports and child rearing -- and whose conclusions regularly turn the conventional wisdom on its head. He usually begins with a mountain of data and a simple, unasked question. Some of these questions concern life-and-death issues; others have an admittedly freakish quality. Thus the new field of study contained in this book: freakonomics.Through forceful storytelling and wry insight, Levitt and co-author Stephen J. Dubner show that economics is, at root, the study of incentives -- how people get what they want, or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing. In Freakonomics, they set out to explore the hidden side of ... well, everything. The inner workings of a crack gang. The truth about real-estate agents. The myths of campaign finance. The telltale marks of a cheating schoolteacher. The secrets of the Ku Klux Klan.What unites all these stories is a belief that the modern world, despite a surfeit of obfuscation, complication, and downright deceit, is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and -- if the right questions are asked -- is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking. Steven Levitt, through devilishly clever and clear-eyed thinking, shows how to see through all the clutter.Freakonomics establishes this unconventional premise: If morality represents how we would like the world to work, then economics represents how it actually does work. It is true that readers of this book will be armed with enough riddles and stories to last a thousand cocktail parties. But Freakonomics can provide more than that. It will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.','Revised and Expanded Edition','Hardcover','9.78006E+12',320,3.95,594154,'Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything (Freakonomics, #1)','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327909092l/1202.jpg','b0182',11.69),

    ('When Stephen Covey first released The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, the book became an instant rage because people suddenly got up and took notice that their lives were headed off in the wrong direction; and more than that, they realized that there were so many simple things they could do in order to navigate their life correctly. This book was wonderful education for people, education in how to live life effectively and get closer to the ideal of being a ‘success’ in life.But not everyone understands Stephen Covey’s model fully well, or maybe there are some people who haven’t read it yet. This is definitely true because we still see so much failure all around us. Now, I am not saying that by using Covey’s model, or anyone else’s model for that matter, you can become a sure-shot success, but at least we should have seen many more successes around us already judging by the number of copies the book has sold! So, where is the shortcoming?There are two main problems here, and we are talking only about the people who have read the book already. The first problem is that most people are too lazy to implement the ideals of Stephen Covey in their lives. They consider his masterpiece of a book as a mere coffee-table book or a book that you use for light reading when you are traveling and then forget all about it. They do not realize that this book contains life-changing information. Or, they take the information and do not make the effort to actually utilize it so that it becomes knowledge for them.The second problem is that a lot of people have a myopic view of Covey’s ideals. These are people who are impressed by the book already. If you ask them what the seven habits are, they can rattle them off end to end, but then they miss the larger picture. They do not understand that Covey was trying to tell more than he wrote in words. There are hidden implications in this book, yes, and a lot of people have just failed to see through them.That is what we are trying to do. We are trying to show you how Covey’s book, or rather, his model, was a complete model in itself. There was nothing amiss about it. If you implement it, there should be no aspect of your life that should go untouched. The only thing is that you have to understand these ideals and try to implement them in your life.But, before we barge into that area, it is extremely important to understand what these ideals are. What was the model that was propounded by Stephen Covey in his mega-famous book?

As a young man he worked many summers in logging camps and for the United States Forest Service. The two novellas and short story in this collection are based on his own experiences—the experiences of a young man who found that life was only a step from art in its structures and beauty.

    ('Eugene Onegin is the master work of the poet whom Russians regard as the fountainhead of their literature. Set in imperial Russia during the 1820s, Pushkin''s novel in verse follows the emotions and destiny of three men - Onegin the bored fop, Lensky the minor elegiast, and a stylized Pushkin himself - and the fates and affections of three women - Tatyana the provincial beauty, her sister Olga, and Pushkin''s mercurial Muse. Engaging, full of suspense, and varied in tone, it also portrays a large cast of other characters and offers the reader many literary, philosophical, and autobiographical digressions, often in a highly satirical vein. Eugene Onegin was Pushkin''s own favourite work, and it shows him attempting to transform himself from romantic poet into realistic novelist. This new translation seeks to retain both the literal sense and the poetic music of the original, and capture the poem''s spontaneity and wit.

    ('Five interconnected, sequential narratives, set in the years from 1960 to 1999. Each story is deeply rooted in the sixties, and each is haunted by the Vietnam War.Stephen King, whose first novel, Carrie, was published in 1974, the year before the last U.S. troops withdrew from Vietnam, is the first hugely popular writer of the TV generation. Images from that war -- and the protests against it -- had flooded America''s living rooms for a decade. Hearts in Atlantis, King''s newest fiction, is composed of five interconnected, sequential narratives, set in the years from 1960 to 1999. Each story is deeply rooted in the sixties, and each is haunted by the Vietnam War. In Part One, "Low Men in Yellow Coats," eleven-year-old Bobby Garfield discovers a world of predatory malice in his own neighborhood. He also discovers that adults are sometimes not rescuers but at the heart of the terror. In the title story, a bunch of college kids get hooked on a card game, discover the possibility of protest...and confront their own collective heart of darkness, where laughter may be no more than the thinly disguised cry of the beast. In "Blind Willie" and "Why We''re in Vietnam," two men who grew up with Bobby in suburban Connecticut try to fill the emptiness of the post-Vietnam era in an America which sometimes seems as hollow -- and as haunted -- as their own lives. And in "Heavenly Shades of Night Are Falling," this remarkable book''s denouement, Bobby returns to his hometown where one final secret, the hope of redemption, and his heart''s desire may await him. Full of danger, full of suspense, most of all full of heart, Stephen King''s new book will take some readers to a place they have never been...and others to a place they have never been able to completely leave.','Film tie-in','Paperback','9.78034E+12',640,3.81,76495,'Hearts in Atlantis','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1374048926l/11602.jpg','b0235',16.21),

    ('The Selfish Gene: 30th Anniversary Edition—with a new Introduction by the AuthorInheriting the mantle of revolutionary biologist from Darwin, Watson, and Crick, Richard Dawkins forced an enormous change in the way we see ourselves and the world with the publication of The Selfish Gene. Suppose, instead of thinking about organisms using genes to reproduce themselves, as we had since Mendel''s work was rediscovered, we turn it around and imagine that "our" genes build and maintain us in order to make more genes. That simple reversal seems to answer many puzzlers which had stumped scientists for years, and we haven''t thought of evolution in the same way since.Why are there miles and miles of "unused" DNA within each of our bodies? Why should a bee give up its own chance to reproduce to help raise her sisters and brothers? With a prophet''s clarity, Dawkins told us the answers from the perspective of molecules competing for limited space and resources to produce more of their own kind. Drawing fascinating examples from every field of biology, he paved the way for a serious re-evaluation of evolution. He also introduced the concept of self-reproducing ideas, or memes, which (seemingly) use humans exclusively for their propagation. If we are puppets, he says, at least we can try to understand our strings. —Rob Lightner','30th Anniversary Edition','Paperback','9.7802E+12',360,4.13,113263,'The Selfish Gene','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1366758096l/61535.jpg','b0264',31.4),

    ('That The Illustrated Man has remained in print since being published in 1951 is fair testimony to the universal appeal of Ray Bradbury''s work. Only his second collection (the first was Dark Carnival, later reworked into The October Country), it is a marvelous, if mostly dark, quilt of science fiction, fantasy, and horror. In an ingenious framework to open and close the book, Bradbury presents himself as a nameless narrator who meets the Illustrated Man--a wanderer whose entire body is a living canvas of exotic tattoos. What''s even more remarkable, and increasingly disturbing, is that the illustrations are themselves magically alive, and each proceeds to unfold its own story, such as "The Veldt," wherein rowdy children take a game of virtual reality way over the edge. Or "Kaleidoscope," a heartbreaking portrait of stranded astronauts about to reenter our atmosphere--without the benefit of a spaceship. Or "Zero Hour," in which invading aliens have discovered a most logical ally--our own children. Even though most were written in the 1940s and 1950s, these 18 classic stories will be just as chillingly effective 50 years from now. --Stanley WiaterContents:· Prologue: The Illustrated Man · ss * · The Veldt [“The World the Children Made”] · ss The Saturday Evening Post Sep 23 ’50 · Kaleidoscope · ss Thrilling Wonder Stories Oct ’49 · The Other Foot · ss New Story Magazine Mar ’51 · The Highway [as by Leonard Spalding] · ss Copy Spr ’50 · The Man · ss Thrilling Wonder Stories Feb ’49 · The Long Rain [“Death-by-Rain”] · ss Planet Stories Sum ’50 · The Rocket Man · ss Maclean’s Mar 1 ’51 · The Fire Balloons [“‘In This Sign...’”] · ss Imagination Apr ’51 · The Last Night of the World · ss Esquire Feb ’51 · The Exiles [“The Mad Wizards of Mars”] · ss Maclean’s Sep 15 ’49; F&SF Win ’50 · No Particular Night or Morning · ss * · The Fox and the Forest [“To the Future”] · ss Colliers May 13 ’50 · The Visitor · ss Startling Stories Nov ’48 · The Concrete Mixer · ss Thrilling Wonder Stories Apr ’49 · Marionettes, Inc.

They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over working in teams. It is to introverts—Rosa Parks, Chopin, Dr. Seuss, Steve Wozniak—that we owe many of the great contributions to society.In Quiet, Susan Cain argues that we dramatically undervalue introverts and shows how much we lose in doing so. She charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal throughout the twentieth century and explores how deeply it has come to permeate our culture. She also introduces us to successful introverts—from a witty, high-octane public speaker who recharges in solitude after his talks, to a record-breaking salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions.

During a chance encounter, the two realize they are identical and, as a lark, decide to exchange clothes and roles--a situation that briefly, but drastically, alters the lives of both youngsters.

    ('Fraa Erasmas is a young avout living in the Concent of Saunt Edhar, a sanctuary for mathematicians, scientists, and philosophers, protected from the corrupting influences of the outside "saecular" world by ancient stone, honored traditions, and complex rituals. Over the centuries, cities and governments have risen and fallen beyond the concent''s walls. Three times during history''s darkest epochs violence born of superstition and ignorance has invaded and devastated the cloistered mathic community. Yet the avout have always managed to adapt in the wake of catastrophe, becoming out of necessity even more austere and less dependent on technology and material things. And Erasmas has no fear of the outside—the Extramuros—for the last of the terrible times was long, long ago.Now, in celebration of the week-long, once-in-a-decade rite of Apert, the fraas and suurs prepare to venture beyond the concent''s gates—at the same time opening them wide to welcome the curious "extras" in. During his first Apert as a fraa, Erasmas eagerly anticipates reconnecting with the landmarks and family he hasn''t seen since he was "collected." But before the week is out, both the existence he abandoned and the one he embraced will stand poised on the brink of cataclysmic change.Powerful unforeseen forces jeopardize the peaceful stability of mathic life and the established ennui of the Extramuros—a threat that only an unsteady alliance of saecular and avout can oppose—as, one by one, Erasmas and his colleagues, teachers, and friends are summoned forth from the safety of the concent in hopes of warding off global disaster. Suddenly burdened with a staggering responsibility, Erasmas finds himself a major player in a drama that will determine the future of his world—as he sets out on an extraordinary odyssey that will carry him to the most dangerous, inhospitable corners of the planet . . . and beyond.','First Edition','Hardcover','9.78006E+12',937,4.18,54282,'Anathem','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1488349209l/2845024.jpg','b0349',28.95),

It is the story of Americans in the ranks, men of every shape, size, and color, farmers, schoolteachers, shoemakers, no-accounts, and mere boys turned soldiers. And it is the story of the King''s men, the British commander, William Howe, an his highly disciplined redcoats who looked on their rebel foes with contempt and fought with a valor too little known.At the center of the drama, with Washington, are two young American patriots, who, at first, knew no more of war than what they had read in books - Nathaniel Green, a Quaker who was made a general at thirty-three, and Henry Knox, a twenty-five-year-old bookseller who had the preposterous idea of hauling the guns of Fort Ticonderoga overland to Boston in the dead of Winter.But it is the American commander-in-chief who stands foremost - Washington, who had never before led an army in battle.

But those 12 years contained some of the most catastrophic events Western civilization has ever known.No other powerful empire ever bequeathed such mountains of evidence about its birth and destruction as the Third Reich. When the bitter war was over, and before the Nazis could destroy their files, the Allied demand for unconditional surrender produced an almost hour-by-hour record of the nightmare empire built by Adolph Hitler. This record included the testimony of Nazi leaders and of concentration camp inmates, the diaries of officials, transcripts of secret conferences, army orders, private letters—all the vast paperwork behind Hitler''s drive to conquer the world.The famed foreign correspondent and historian William L. Shirer, who had watched and reported on the Nazis since 1925, spent five and a half years sifting through this massive documentation. The result is a monumental study that has been widely acclaimed as the definitive record of one of the most frightening chapters in the history of mankind.This worldwide bestseller has been acclaimed as the definitive book on Nazi Germany; it is a classic work.The accounts of how the United States got involved and how Hitler used Mussolini and Japan are astonishing, and the coverage of the war-from Germany''s early successes to her eventual defeat-is must reading','50th Anniversary Edition','Mass Market Paperback','9.78067E+12',1614,4.16,80424,'The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1331223772l/767171.jpg','b0353',34.08),

Following years of lonely political exile in Western Europe, Ka, a middle-aged poet, returns to Istanbul to attend his mother''s funeral. Only partly recognizing this place of his cultured, middle-class youth, he is even more disoriented by news of strange events in the wider country: a wave of suicides among girls forbidden to wear their head scarves at school. An apparent thaw of his writer''s curiosity–a frozen sea these many years–leads him to Kars, a far-off town near the Russian border and the epicenter of the suicides. No sooner has he arrived, however, than we discover that Ka''s motivations are not purely journalistic; for in Kars, once a province of Ottoman and then Russian glory, now a cultural gray-zone of poverty and paralysis, there is also Ipek, a radiant friend of Ka''s youth, lately divorced, whom he has never forgotten. As a snowstorm, the fiercest in memory, descends on the town and seals it off from the modern, westernized world that has always been Ka''s frame of reference, he finds himself drawn in unexpected directions: not only headlong toward the unknowable Ipek and the desperate hope for love–or at least a wife–that she embodies, but also into the maelstrom of a military coup staged to restrain the local Islamist radicals, and even toward God, whose existence Ka has never before allowed himself to contemplate. In this surreal confluence of emotion and spectacle, Ka begins to tap his dormant creative powers, producing poem after poem in untimely, irresistible bursts of inspiration. But not until the snows have melted and the political violence has run its bloody course will Ka discover the fate of his bid to seize a last chance for happiness.

This is his superb account of his life up until that ''bitter leave-taking'': from his childhood and desperately unhappy school days at Charterhouse, to his time serving as a young officer in the First World War that was to haunt him throughout his life.

He is best known for the historical novel I, Claudius and the critical study of myth and poetry The White Goddess.

Graves also translated Apuleius, Lucan and Suetonius for the Penguin Classics, and compiled the first modern dictionary of Greek Mythology, The Greek Myths.

Now the District is set to revert to Alaskan control, and their dream is coming to an end: once again the tides of history threaten to sweep them up and carry them off into the unknown.For sixty years, Jewish refugees and their descendants have prospered in the Federal District of Sitka, a "temporary" safe haven created in the wake of revelations of the Holocaust and the shocking 1948 collapse of the fledgling state of Israel. Proud, grateful, and longing to be American, the Jews of the Sitka District have created their own little world in the Alaskan panhandle, a vibrant, gritty, soulful, and complex frontier city that moves to the music of Yiddish. For sixty years they have been left alone, neglected and half-forgotten in a backwater of history. Now the District is set to revert to Alaskan control, and their dream is coming to an end: once again the tides of history threaten to sweep them up and carry them off into the unknown. But homicide detective Meyer Landsman of the District Police has enough problems without worrying about the upcoming Reversion. His life is a shambles, his marriage a wreck, his career a disaster. He and his half-Tlingit partner, Berko Shemets, can''t catch a break in any of their outstanding cases. Landsman''s new supervisor is the love of his life—and also his worst nightmare. And in the cheap hotel where he has washed up, someone has just committed a murder—right under Landsman''s nose. Out of habit, obligation, and a mysterious sense that it somehow offers him a shot at redeeming himself, Landsman begins to investigate the killing of his neighbor, a former chess prodigy. But when word comes down from on high that the case is to be dropped immediately, Landsman soon finds himself contending with all the powerful forces of faith, obsession, hopefulness, evil, and salvation that are his heritage—and with the unfinished business of his marriage to Bina Gelbfish, the one person who understands his darkest fears. At once a gripping whodunit, a love story, an homage to 1940s noir, and an exploration of the mysteries of exile and redemption, The Yiddish Policemen''s Union is a novel only Michael Chabon could have written.','First Edition','Hardcover','9.78001E+12',414,3.7,56082,'The Yiddish Policemen''s Union','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1528196883l/16703.jpg','b0454',37.22),

The Pentagon has officially confirmed more than 150 of Kyle''s kills (the previous American record was 109), but it has declined to verify the astonishing total number for this book. Iraqi insurgents feared Kyle so much they named him al-Shaitan (“the devil”) and placed a bounty on his head. Kyle earned legendary status among his fellow SEALs, Marines, and U.S. Army soldiers, whom he protected with deadly accuracy from rooftops and stealth positions. Gripping and unforgettable, Kyle’s masterful account of his extraordinary battlefield experiences ranks as one of the great war memoirs of all time.A native Texan who learned to shoot on childhood hunting trips with his father, Kyle was a champion saddle-bronc rider prior to joining the Navy. After 9/11, he was thrust onto the front lines of the War on Terror, and soon found his calling as a world-class sniper who performed best under fire. He recorded a personal-record 2,100-yard kill shot outside Baghdad; in Fallujah, Kyle braved heavy fire to rescue a group of Marines trapped on a street; in Ramadi, he stared down insurgents with his pistol in close combat. Kyle talks honestly about the pain of war—of twice being shot and experiencing the tragic deaths of two close friends.American Sniper also honors Kyles fellow warriors, who raised hell on and off the battlefield. And in moving first-person accounts throughout, Kyles wife, Taya, speaks openly about the strains of war on their marriage and children, as well as on Chris.Adrenaline-charged and deeply personal, American Sniper is a thrilling eyewitness account of war that only one man could tell.','Large Print','Paperback','9.78006E+12',528,3.98,91641,'American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348628279l/11887020.jpg','b0487',36.36),

That is, until Seth Grahame-Smith stumbled upon The Secret Journal of Abraham Lincoln, and became the first living person to lay eyes on it in more than 140 years.Using the journal as his guide and writing in the grand biographical style of Doris Kearns Goodwin and David McCullough, Seth has reconstructed the true life story of our greatest president for the first time-all while revealing the hidden history behind the Civil War and uncovering the role vampires played in the birth, growth, and near-death of our nation.','First','Hardcover','9.78045E+12',336,3.7,123172,'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1291165397l/7108001.jpg','b0508',40.25),

With a tremendous cracking and splintering of oak, it struck the ship just beneath the anchor secured at the cat-head on the port bow..." In the Heart of the Sea brings to new life the incredible story of the wreck of the whaleship Essex - an event as mythic in its own century as the Titanic disaster in ours, and the inspiration for the climax of Moby-Dick. In a harrowing page-turner, Nathaniel Philbrick restores this epic story to its rightful place in American history.In 1820, the 240-ton Essex set sail from Nantucket on a routine voyage for whales. Fifteen months later, in the farthest reaches of the South Pacific, it was repeatedly rammed and sunk by an eighty-ton bull sperm whale. Its twenty-man crew, fearing cannibals on the islands to the west, made for the 3,000-mile-distant coast of South America in three tiny boats. During ninety days at sea under horrendous conditions, the survivors clung to life as one by one, they succumbed to hunger, thirst, disease, and fear.In the Heart of the Sea tells perhaps the greatest sea story ever. Philbrick interweaves his account of this extraordinary ordeal of ordinary men with a wealth of whale lore and with a brilliantly detailed portrait of the lost, unique community of Nantucket whalers. Impeccably researched and beautifully told, the book delivers the ultimate portrait of man against nature, drawing on a remarkable range of archival and modern sources, including a long-lost account by the ship''s cabin boy.At once a literary companion and a page-turner that speaks to the same issues of class, race, and man''s relationship to nature that permeate the works of Melville, In the Heart of the Sea will endure as a vital work of American history.','First Edition','Paperback','9.78014E+12',302,4.15,69434,'In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1335902168l/17780.jpg','b0532',25.6),

    ('THE FIRST MAJOR WORK IN NEARLY A DECADE BY ONE OF THE WORLD’S GREAT THINKERS—A MARVELOUSLY CONCISE BOOK WITH NEW ANSWERS TO THE ULTIMATE QUESTIONS OF LIFE When and how did the universe begin? Why are we here? Why is there something rather than nothing? What is the nature of reality? Why are the laws of nature so finely tuned as to allow for the existence of beings like ourselves? And, finally, is the apparent “grand design” of our universe evidence of a benevolent creator who set things in motion—or does science offer another explanation? The most fundamental questions about the origins of the universe and of life itself, once the province of philosophy, now occupy the territory where scientists, philosophers, and theologians meet—if only to disagree. In their new book, Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow present the most recent scientific thinking about the mysteries of the universe, in nontechnical language marked by both brilliance and simplicity. In The Grand Design they explain that according to quantum theory, the cosmos does not have just a single existence or history, but rather that every possible history of the universe exists simultaneously. When applied to the universe as a whole, this idea calls into question the very notion of cause and effect. But the “top-down” approach to cosmology that Hawking and Mlodinow describe would say that the fact that the past takes no definite form means that we create history by observing it, rather than that history creates us. The authors further explain that we ourselves are the product of quantum fluctuations in the very early universe, and show how quantum theory predicts the “multiverse”—the idea that ours is just one of many universes that appeared spontaneously out of nothing, each with different laws of nature.Along the way Hawking and Mlodinow question the conventional concept of reality, posing a “model-dependent” theory of reality as the best we can hope to find. And they conclude with a riveting assessment of M-theory, an explanation of the laws governing us and our universe that is currently the only viable candidate for a complete “theory of everything.” If confirmed, they write, it will be the unified theory that Einstein was looking for, and the ultimate triumph of human reason.A succinct, startling, and lavishly illustrated guide to discoveries that are altering our understanding and threatening some of our most cherished belief systems, The Grand Design is a book that will inform—and provoke—like no other.','First Edition','Hardcover','9.78055E+12',199,4.03,53545,'The Grand Design','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320558363l/8520362.jpg','b0551',19.32),

Here is the continuation of her fascinating story. In 1984, Marjane flees fundamentalism and the war with Iraq to begin a new life in Vienna. Once there, she faces the trials of adolescence far from her friends and family, and while she soon carves out a place for herself among a group of fellow outsiders, she continues to struggle for a sense of belonging.Finding that she misses her home more than she can stand, Marjane returns to Iran after graduation. Her difficult homecoming forces her to confront the changes both she and her country have undergone in her absence and her shame at what she perceives as her failure in Austria. Marjane allows her past to weigh heavily on her until she finds some like-minded friends, falls in love, and begins studying art at a university. However, the repression and state-sanctioned chauvinism eventually lead her to question whether she can have a future in Iran.As funny and poignant as its predecessor, Persepolis 2 is another clear-eyed and searing condemnation of the human cost of fundamentalism.

    ('''This was much more than a bunch of guys out on an exploring and collecting expedition. This was a military expedition into hostile territory''. In 1803 President Thomas Jefferson selected his personal secretary, Captain Meriwether Lewis, to lead a pioneering voyage across the Great Plains and into the Rockies. It was completely uncharted territory; a wild, vast land ruled by the Indians. Charismatic and brave, Lewis was the perfect choice and he experienced the savage North American continent before any other white man. UNDAUNTED COURAGE is the tale of a hero, but it is also a tragedy. Lewis may have received a hero''s welcome on his return to Washington in 1806, but his discoveries did not match the president''s fantasies of sweeping, fertile plains ripe for the taking. Feeling the expedition had been a failure, Lewis took to drink and piled up debts. Full of colourful characters - Jefferson, the president obsessed with conquering the west; William Clark, the rugged frontiersman; Sacagawea, the Indian girl who accompanied the expedition; Drouillard, the French-Indian hunter - this is one of the great adventure stories of all time and it shot to the top of the US bestseller charts.

    ('In a profound work that pivots from the biggest questions about American history and ideals to the most intimate concerns of a father for his son, Ta-Nehisi Coates offers a powerful new framework for understanding our nation’s history and current crisis. Americans have built an empire on the idea of “race,” a falsehood that damages us all but falls most heavily on the bodies of black women and men—bodies exploited through slavery and segregation, and, today, threatened, locked up, and murdered out of all proportion. What is it like to inhabit a black body and find a way to live within it? And how can we all honestly reckon with this fraught history and free ourselves from its burden?Between the World and Me is Ta-Nehisi Coates’s attempt to answer these questions in a letter to his adolescent son. Coates shares with his son—and readers—the story of his awakening to the truth about his place in the world through a series of revelatory experiences, from Howard University to Civil War battlefields, from the South Side of Chicago to Paris, from his childhood home to the living rooms of mothers whose children’s lives were taken as American plunder.

    ('A groundbreaking study that radically alters our understanding of the Americas before the arrival of the Europeans in 1492.Traditionally, Americans learned in school that the ancestors of the people who inhabited the Western Hemisphere at the time of Columbus’s landing had crossed the Bering Strait twelve thousand years ago; existed mainly in small, nomadic bands; and lived so lightly on the land that the Americas was, for all practical purposes, still a vast wilderness. But as Charles C. Mann now makes clear, archaeologists and anthropologists have spent the last thirty years proving these and many other long-held assumptions wrong.In a book that startles and persuades, Mann reveals how a new generation of researchers equipped with novel scientific techniques came to previously unheard-of conclusions. Among them:In 1491 there were probably more people living in the Americas than in Europe.Certain cities–such as Tenochtitlán, the Aztec capital–were far greater in population than any contemporary European city. Furthermore, Tenochtitlán, unlike any capital in Europe at that time, had running water, beautiful botanical gardens, and immaculately clean streets.The earliest cities in the Western Hemisphere were thriving before the Egyptians built the great pyramids.Pre-Columbian Indians in Mexico developed corn by a breeding process so sophisticated that the journal Science recently described it as "man’s first, and perhaps the greatest, feat of genetic engineering."Amazonian Indians learned how to farm the rain forest without destroying it–a process scientists are studying today in the hope of regaining this lost knowledge.Native Americans transformed their land so completely that Europeans arrived in a hemisphere already massively "landscaped" by human beings.Mann sheds clarifying light on the methods used to arrive at these new visions of the pre-Columbian Americas and how they have affected our understanding of our history and our thinking about the environment.

The Stoic philosophy which Seneca professed in his writings, later supported by Marcus Aurelius, provided Rome with a passable bridge to Christianity. Seneca''s major contribution to Stoicism was to spiritualize and humanize a system which could appear cold and unrealistic.Selected from the Epistulae Morales ad Lucilium, these letters illustrate the upright ideals admired by the Stoics and extol the good way of life as seen from their standpoint. They also reveal how far in advance of his time were many of Seneca''s ideas - his disgust at the shows in the arena or his criticism of the harsh treatment of slaves.

    ('#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER & NOW A MAJOR MOTION PICTUREStraight from the front line of urban America, the inspiring story of one fiercely determined teacher and her remarkable students.As an idealistic twenty-three-year-old English teacher at Wilson High School in Long beach, California, Erin Gruwell confronted a room of “unteachable, at-risk” students. One day she intercepted a note with an ugly racial caricature, and angrily declared that this was precisely the sort of thing that led to the Holocaust—only to be met by uncomprehending looks. So she and her students, using the treasured books Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl and Zlata’s Diary: A Child’s Life in Sarajevo as their guides, undertook a life-changing, eye-opening, spirit-raising odyssey against intolerance and misunderstanding. They learned to see the parallels in these books to their own lives, recording their thoughts and feelings in diaries and dubbing themselves the “Freedom Writers” in homage to the civil rights activists “The Freedom Riders.”With funds raised by a “Read-a-thon for Tolerance,” they arranged for Miep Gies, the courageous Dutch woman who sheltered the Frank family, to visit them in California, where she declared that Erin Gruwell’s students were “the real heroes.” Their efforts have paid off spectacularly, both in terms of recognition—appearances on “Prime Time Live” and “All Things Considered,” coverage in People magazine, a meeting with U.S. Secretary of Education Richard Riley—and educationally. All 150 Freedom Writers have graduated from high school and are now attending college.With powerful entries from the students’ own diaries and a narrative text by Erin Gruwell, The Freedom Writers Diary is an uplifting, unforgettable example of how hard work, courage, and the spirit of determination changed the lives of a teacher and her students. The authors’ proceeds from this book will be donated to The Tolerance Education Foundation, an organization set up to pay for the Freedom Writers’ college tuition.

    ('A classic work in political philosophy, intellectual and cultural history, and economics, The Road to Serfdom has inspired and infuriated politicians, scholars, and general readers for half a century. Originally published in England in the spring of 1944—when Eleanor Roosevelt supported the efforts of Stalin, and Albert Einstein subscribed lock, stock, and barrel to the socialist program—The Road to Serfdom was seen as heretical for its passionate warning against the dangers of state control over the means of production. For F. A. Hayek, the collectivist idea of empowering government with increasing economic control would inevitably lead not to a utopia but to the horrors of nazi Germany and fascist Italy.First published by the University of Chicago Press on September 18, 1944, The Road to Serfdom garnered immediate attention from the public, politicians, and scholars alike. The first printing of 2,000 copies was exhausted instantly, and within six months more than 30,000 were sold. In April of 1945, Reader''s Digest published a condensed version of the book, and soon thereafter the Book-of-the-Month Club distributed this condensation to more than 600,000 readers. A perennial best-seller, the book has sold over a quarter of a million copies in the United States, not including the British edition or the nearly twenty translations into such languages as German, French, Dutch, Swedish, and Japanese, and not to mention the many underground editions produced in Eastern Europe before the fall of the iron curtain.After thirty-two printings in the United States, The Road to Serfdom has established itself alongside the works of Alexis de Tocqueville, John Stuart Mill, and George Orwell for its timeless meditation on the relation between individual liberty and government authority. This fiftieth anniversary edition, with a new introduction by Milton Friedman, commemorates the enduring influence of The Road to Serfdom on the ever-changing political and social climates of the twentieth century, from the rise of socialism after World War II to the Reagan and Thatcher "revolutions" in the 1980s and the transitions in Eastern Europe from communism to capitalism in the 1990s.F. A. Hayek (1899-1992), recipient of the Medal of Freedom in 1991 and co-winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 1974, was a pioneer in monetary theory and the principal proponent of libertarianism in the twentieth century.On the first American edition of The Road to Serfdom:"One of the most important books of our generation. . . . It restates for our time the issue between liberty and authority with the power and rigor of reasoning with which John Stuart Mill stated the issue for his own generation in his great essay On Liberty. . . . It is an arresting call to all well-intentioned planners and socialists, to all those who are sincere democrats and liberals at heart to stop, look and listen."—Henry Hazlitt, New York Times Book Review, September 1944"In the negative part of Professor Hayek''s thesis there is a great deal of truth. It cannot be said too often—at any rate, it is not being said nearly often enough—that collectivism is not inherently democratic, but, on the contrary, gives to a tyrannical minority such powers as the Spanish Inquisitors never dreamt of."—George Orwell, Collected Essays','Fiftieth Anniversary Edition','Paperback','9.78023E+12',274,4.18,15685,'The Road to Serfdom','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327787673l/299215.jpg','b0663',29.44),

In the suburban streets of Calcutta where they wandered before dusk and in the hyacinth-strewn ponds where they played for hours on end, Udayan was always in his older brother''s sight.

He seems born to trouble and, when his lord orders him to London as part of a force sent to quell an expected Lollard uprising, Nick''s headstrong behaviour leads to him being proscribed an outlaw. He finds refuge across the Channel, part of an English mercenary force protecting the town of Soissons against the French. What happened at the Siege of Soissons shocked all Europe, and propels Nick back to England where he is enrolled in the archer companyof the doughty Sir John Cornwaille, a leader of Henry V''s army. The army was superb, but sickness and the unexpected French defiance at Harfleur, reduce it to near-shambolic condition. Henry stubbornly refuses to accept defeat and, in appalling weather, leads his shrunken force to what appears to be inevitable disaster.Azincourt culminates in the battle. Seen from several points of view on the English side, but also from the French ranks, the scene is vivid, convincing and compelling. Bernard Cornwell has a great understanding of men at war and battlefields and this is his masterpiece. This is what it must have been like to fight at Agincourt.','First','Hardcover','9.78001E+12',453,4.12,19936,'Azincourt','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327151016l/3276012.jpg','b0682',21.89),

    ('When Tiro, the confidential secretary (and slave) of a Roman senator, opens the door to a terrified stranger on a cold November morning, he sets in motion a chain of events that will eventually propel his master into one of the most suspenseful courtroom dramas in history. The stranger is a Sicilian, a victim of the island''s corrupt Roman governor, Verres. The senator is Marcus Cicero -- an ambitious young lawyer and spellbinding orator, who at the age of twenty-seven is determined to attain imperium -- supreme power in the state.  Of all the great figures of the Roman world, none was more fascinating or charismatic than Cicero. And Tiro -- the inventor of shorthand and author of numerous books, including a celebrated biography of his master (which was lost in the Dark Ages) -- was always by his side.  Compellingly written in Tiro''s voice, Imperium is the re-creation of his vanished masterpiece, recounting in vivid detail the story of Cicero''s quest for glory, competing with some of the most powerful and intimidating figures of his -- or any other -- age: Pompey, Caesar, Crassus, and the many other powerful Romans who changed history.  Robert Harris, the world''s master of innovative historical fiction, lures us into a violent, treacherous world of Roman politics at once exotically different from and yet startlingly similar to our own -- a world of Senate intrigue and electoral corruption, special prosecutors and political adventurism -- to describe how one clever, compassionate, devious, vulnerable man fought to reach the top.Page Numbers Source ISBN: 0099406314','First Edition','Hardcover','9.78074E+12',305,4.07,20947,'Imperium: A Novel of Ancient Rome','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1442657816l/243601.jpg','b0687',6.38),

Palace Walk introduces us to his gentle, oppressed wife, Amina, his cloistered daughters, Aisha and Khadija, and his three sons–the tragic and idealistic Fahmy, the dissolute hedonist Yasin, and the soul-searching intellectual Kamal. Al-Sayyid Ahmad’s rebellious children struggle to move beyond his domination in Palace of Desire, as the world around them opens to the currents of modernity and political and domestic turmoil brought by the 1920s.

    ('Length: 126 hrs and 31 minsThe History of the Decline & Fall of the Roman Empire was written by English historian Edward Gibbon & originally published in six quarto volumes. Volume 1 was published in 1776, going thru six printings; 2-3 in 1781; 4-6 in 1788-89. It was a major literary achievement of the 18th century, adopted as a model for the methodologies of historians.The books cover the Roman Empire after Marcus Aurelius, from 180 to 1590. They take as their material the behavior & decisions that led to the eventual fall of the Empire in East & West, offering explanations.Gibbon is called the 1st modern historian of ancient Rome. By virtue of its mostly objective approach & accurate use of reference material, his work was adopted as a model for the methodologies of 19-20th century historians. His pessimism & detached irony was common to the historical genre of his era. Although he published other books, Gibbon devoted much of his life (1772-89) to this one work. His Memoirs of My Life & Writings is devoted largely to his reflections on how the book virtually became his life. He compared the publication of each succeeding volume to a newborn.Gibbon offers an explanation for why the Roman Empire fell, a task difficult because of few comprehensive written sources, tho he wasn''t the only historian to tackle the subject. Most of his ideas are taken from what few relevant records were available: those of Roman moralists of the 4-5th centuries. According to Gibbon, the Empire succumbed to barbarian invasions because of lost of civic virtue. They''d become weak, outsourcing defence to barbarian mercenaries, who became so numerous & ingrained that they took over. Romans had become effeminate, incapable of tough military lifestyles. In addition, Christianity created belief that a better life existed after death, fostering indifference to the present, sapping patriotism. Its comparative pacifism tended to hamper martial spirit. Lastly, like other Enlightenment thinkers, he held in contempt the Middle Ages as a priest-ridden, superstitious, dark age. It wasn''t until his age of reason that history could progress.','abridged','Paperback','9.78038E+12',1312,3.97,10580,'The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1435759367l/19400.jpg','b0754',33.64),

    ('The long-awaited and highly anticipated final volume in Penman’s trilogy of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine—a tumultuous conclusion to this timeless story of love, power, ambition, and betrayal. Where the second novel in the trilogy, Time And Chance, dealt with the extraordinary politics of the twelfth century, climaxing with the murder of Thomas Becket and Henry’s confrontation with the Church and self-imposed exile to Ireland, Devil’s Brood centers on the implosion of a family. And because it is a royal family whose domains span the English Channel and whose alliances encompass the Christian world, that collapse will have dire consequences. This is a story of betrayal as Henry’s three eldest sons and his wife enter into a rebellion against him, aligning themselves with his bitterest enemy, King Louis of France. But it is also the story of a great king whose brilliance forged an empire but whose personal blind spots led him into the most serious mistake of his life. Sharon Kay Penman has created a novel of tremendous power, as two strong-willed, passionate people clash, a family divides, and a marriage ends in all but name. Curiously, it is a novel without villains—only flawed human beings caught up in misperceptions and bad judgment calls. Most devastating to Henry was not his sons’ rebellion but his wife’s betrayal in joining them. How could it happen that two people whose love for each other was all consuming end up as bitter adversaries? That is the heart of Penman’s tale in Devil’s Brood.','First US Edition','Hardcover','9.7804E+12',736,4.37,6223,'Devil''s Brood','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1448656070l/2859559.jpg','b0771',30.36),

As she describes her heroine''s entry into society, womanhood and, inevitably, love, Burney exposes the vulnerability of female innocence in an image-conscious and often cruel world where social snobbery and sexual aggression are played out in the public arenas of pleasure-gardens, theatre visits, and balls. But Evelina''s innocence also makes her a shrewd commentator on the excesses and absurdities of manners and social ambitions--as well as attracting the attention of the eminently eligible Lord Orville. Evelina, comic and shrewd, is at once a guide to fashionable London, a satirical attack on the new consumerism, an investigation of women''s position in the late eighteenth century, and a love story.

    ('She is the story of Cambridge professor Horace Holly and his ward Leo Vincey, and their journey to a lost kingdom in the African interior. The journey is triggered by a mysterious package left to Leo by his father, to be opened on his 25th birthday; the package contains an ancient shard of pottery and several documents, suggesting an ancient mystery about the Vincey family. Holly and Leo eventually arrive in eastern Africa where they encounter a primitive race of natives and a mysterious white queen, Ayesha, who reigns as the all-powerful "She" or "She-who-must-be-obeyed" and who has a mysterious connection to young Leo.

    ('Mickey Thorn has horribly frightening and realistic dreams, almost nightly. When he awakes, the nightmare''s grip still affects him to such a point, he can''t tell the difference between the dream he was just having, and reality. Mickey knows every detail of his nightmare when he first awakes, but as time passes, and his heart and breathing slow, he has already forgotten most of the details. The overwhelming emotions he goes through from first awakening until he is fully awake is; terror, fear, confusion, then helplessness. What Mickey has just gone through is very rare, and still largely misunderstood. Mickey is suffering from "Night Terrors". A symptom of the "Terrors" is a continued, long-term memory of impossible danger, terrifying monsters, and strange situations, that seem so real, Mickey can swear that they aren''t dreams. Mickey has been through three sleep studies to see if anything can be done to eliminate the terrors, or at least slow them down. What his body goes through---both physically and emotionally---is taking a toll. The doctors have a real fear that Mickey will suffer a heart attack, or stroke, or embolism during one of the more intense episodes. None of the suggestions the doctors have previously given him have worked; exercise, eliminating caffeine, taking medication, and even yoga, have helped. Lately, Mickey has begun to think of his dreams in an entirely new way. What if, instead of bad dreams, this is real? In his frazzled mind, this bizarre notion actually makes sense to him. What if he really is being attacked by monsters from other worlds and dimensions? Oddly, compared to what he is already going through, this new idea doesn''t scare him. In fact, a part of his mind welcomes this possibility, and now he realizes that maybe he isn''t the same person he once was...at all.','First','Paperback','9.78161E+12',274,3.59,56,'When Earthlings Weep','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1333395262l/13574635.jpg','b0853',8.58),

    ('The Tao Te Ching, the esoteric but infinitely practical book written most probably in the sixth century B.C. by Lao Tsu, has been translated more frequently than any work except the Bible. This translation of the Chinese classic, which was first published twenty-five years ago, has sold more copies than any of the others. It offers the essence of each word and makes Lao Tsu''s teaching immediate and alive.The philosophy of Lao Tsu is simple: Accept what is in front of you without wanting the situation to be other than it is. Study the natural order of things and work with it rather than against it, for to try to change what is only sets up resistance. Nature provides everything without requiring payment or thanks, and also provides for all without discrimination—therefore let us present the same face to everyone and treat all men as equals, however they may behave. If we watch carefully, we will see that work proceeds more quickly and easily if we stop "trying," if we stop putting in so much extra effort, if we stop looking for results. In the clarity of a still and open mind, truth will be reflected. We will come to appreciate the original meaning of the word "understand," which means "to stand under." We serve whatever or whoever stands before us, without any thought for ourselves. Te—which may be translated as "virtue" or "strength"—lies always in Tao, or" natural law.

A keepsake enjoyed by tea lovers for over a hundred years, The Book of Tea Classic Edition will enhance your enjoyment and understanding of the seemingly simple act of making and drinking tea.In 1906 in turn-of-the-century Boston, a small, esoteric book about tea was written with the intention of being read aloud in the famous salon of Isabella Gardner, Boston''s most notorious socialite. It was authored by Okakura Kakuzo, a Japanese philosopher, art expert, and curator. Little known at the time, Kakuzo would emerge as one of the great thinkers of the early 20th century, a genius who was insightful, witty—and greatly responsible for bridging Western and Eastern cultures. Okakura had been taught at a young age to speak English and was more than capable of expressing to Westerners the nuances of tea and the Japanese Tea Ceremony.In The Book of Tea Classic Edition, he discusses such topics as Zen and Taoism, but also the secular aspects of tea and Japanese life. The book emphasizes how Teaism taught the Japanese many things; most importantly, simplicity. Kakuzo argues that tea-induced simplicity affected the culture, art and architecture of Japan.Nearly a century later, Kakuzo''s The Book of Tea Classic Edition is still beloved the world over, making it an essential part of any tea enthusiast''s collection. Interwoven with a rich history of Japanese tea and its place in Japanese society is a poignant commentary on Asian culture and our ongoing fascination with it, as well as illuminating essays on art, spirituality, poetry, and more.

In Chaos, James Gleick, a former science writer for the New York Times, shows that he resides in this exclusive category. Here he takes on the job of depicting the first years of the study of chaos--the seemingly random patterns that characterise many natural phenomena. This is not a purely technical book. Instead, it focuses as much on the scientists studying chaos as on the chaos itself. In the pages of Gleick''s book, the reader meets dozens of extraordinary and eccentric people. For instance, Mitchell Feigenbaum, who constructed and regulated his life by a 26-hour clock and watched his waking hours come in and out of phase with those of his coworkers at Los Alamos National Laboratory. As for chaos itself, Gleick does an outstanding job of explaining the thought processes and investigative techniques that researchers bring to bear on chaos problems.

    ('From the #1 New York Times bestselling author and master of narrative nonfiction comes the enthralling story of the sinking of the LusitaniaOn May 1, 1915, a luxury ocean liner as richly appointed as an English country house sailed out of New York, bound for Liverpool, carrying a record number of children and infants. The passengers were anxious. Germany had declared the seas around Britain to be a war zone, and for months, its U-boats had brought terror to the North Atlantic. But the Lusitania was one of the era''s great transatlantic "Greyhounds" and her captain, William Thomas Turner, placed tremendous faith in the gentlemanly strictures of warfare that for a century had kept civilian ships safe from attack. He knew, moreover, that his ship - the fastest then in service - could outrun any threat. Germany, however, was determined to change the rules of the game, and Walther Schwieger, the captain of Unterseeboot-20, was happy to oblige. Meanwhile, an ultra-secret British intelligence unit tracked Schwieger''s U-boat, but told no one. As U-20 and the Lusitania made their way toward Liverpool, an array of forces both grand and achingly small - hubris, a chance fog, a closely guarded secret, and more--all converged to produce one of the great disasters of history. It is a story that many of us think we know but don''t, and Erik Larson tells it thrillingly, switching between hunter and hunted while painting a larger portrait of America at the height of the Progressive Era. Full of glamour, mystery, and real-life suspense, Dead Wake brings to life a cast of evocative characters, from famed Boston bookseller Charles Lauriat to pioneering female architect Theodate Pope Riddle to President Wilson, a man lost to grief, dreading the widening war but also captivated by the prospect of new love.

Born into minor German nobility, she transformed herself into an empress by sheer determination. Possessing a brilliant, curious mind, she devoured the works of Enlightenment philosophers, and reaching the throne, tried using their principles to rule the vast, backward empire. She knew or corresponded with notable figures of her time: Voltaire, Diderot, Frederick the Great, Maria Theresa of Austria, Marie Antoinette & John Paul Jones. Wanting to be the “benevolent despot” Montesquieu idealized, she contended with the deeply ingrained realities of Russian life, including serfdom. She persevered, and for 34 years the government, foreign policy, cultural development and welfare of the Russian people were in her hands. She dealt with domestic rebellion, wars & the tides of political change and violence inspired by the French Revolution. Her reputation depended on the perspective of the speaker. She was praised by Voltaire as like the classical philosophers. She was condemned by enemies, mostly foreign, as “the Messalina of the north.” Her family, friends, ministers, generals, lovers and enemies are vividly described. These included her ambitious, scheming mother; her weak, bullying husband, Peter (who left her sexually untouched for nine years after their marriage); her unhappy son & heir, Paul; her beloved grandchildren; and her favorites—the young men from whom she sought companionship and the recapture of youth as well as sex. Here, too, is Gregory Potemkin, her most significant lover & possible husband, with whom she shared a correspondence of love & separation, followed by 17 years of unparalleled mutual achievement.

Based on more than two hundred personal interviews with both current and former Scientologists--both famous and less well known--and years of archival research, Lawrence Wright uses his extraordinary investigative skills to uncover for us the inner workings of the Church of Scientology: its origins in the imagination of science-fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard; its struggles to find acceptance as a legitimate (and legally acknowledged) religion; its vast, secret campaign to infiltrate the U.S. government; and its dramatic efforts to grow and prevail after the death of Hubbard.At the book''s center, two men whom Wright brings vividly to life, showing how they have made Scientology what it is today: The darkly brilliant L. Ron Hubbard--whose restless, expansive mind invented a new religion tailor-made to prosper in the spiritually troubled post-World War II era. And his successor, David Miscavige--tough and driven, with the unenviable task of preserving the church in the face of ongoing scandals and continual legal assaults.We learn about Scientology''s esoteric cosmology; about the auditing process that determines an inductee''s state of being; about the Bridge to Total Freedom, through which members gain eternal life. We see the ways in which the church pursues celebrities, such as Tom Cruise and John Travolta, and how young idealists who joined the Sea Org, the church''s clergy, whose members often enter as children, signing up with a billion-year contract and working with little pay in poor conditions. We meet men and women "disconnected" from friends and family by the church''s policy of shunning critical voices. And we discover, through many firsthand stories, the violence that has long permeated the inner sanctum of the church.In Going Clear, Wright examines what fundamentally makes a religion a religion, and whether Scientology is, in fact, deserving of the constitutional protections achieved in its victory over the IRS. Employing all his exceptional journalistic skills of observations, understanding, and synthesis, and his ability to shape a story into a compelling narrative, Lawrence Wright has given us an evenhanded yet keenly incisive book that goes far beyond an immediate exposé and uncovers the very essence of what makes Scientology the institution it is.','First Edition','Hardcover','9.78031E+12',430,4.03,33563,'Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1358119149l/16142053.jpg','b1022',16.4),

That book was the last surviving manuscript of an ancient Roman philosophical epic, On the Nature of Things, by Lucretius—a beautiful poem of the most dangerous ideas: that the universe functioned without the aid of gods, that religious fear was damaging to human life, and that matter was made up of very small particles in eternal motion, colliding and swerving in new directions.The copying and translation of this ancient book—the greatest discovery of the greatest book-hunter of his age—fueled the Renaissance, inspiring artists such as Botticelli and thinkers such as Giordano Bruno; shaped the thought of Galileo and Freud, Darwin and Einstein; and had a revolutionary influence on writers such as Montaigne and Shakespeare and even Thomas Jefferson.','1st Edition','Hardcover','9.78039E+12',356,3.84,23065,'The Swerve: How the World Became Modern','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1406088245l/10954979.jpg','b1030',31.37),

    ('The I Ching, or Book of Changes, is one of the 1st efforts of the human mind to place itself within the universe. It has exerted a living influence in China for 3000 years and interest in it has spread in the West. Set down in the dawn of history as a book of oracles, the Book of Changes deepened in meaning when ethical values were attached to the oracular pronouncements; it became a book of wisdom, eventually one of the Five Classics of Confucianism, and provided the common source for both Confucianist and Taoist philosophy. Wilhelm''s rendering of the I Ching into German, published in 1924, presented it for the 1st time in a form intelligible to the general reader. Wilhelm, who translated many other ancient Chinese works and who wrote several books on Chinese philosophy and civilization, long resided in China. His close association with its cultural leaders gave him a unique understanding of the text of the I Ching. In the English translation, every effort has been made to preserve Wilhelm''s pioneering insight into the spirit of the original.This 3rd edition, completely reset, contains a new forward by Hellmut Wilhelm, one of the most eminent American scholars of Chinese culture. He discusses his father''s textual methods and summarizes recent studies of the I Ching both in the West and in present-day China.

    ('This work reveals competitive strategy and insider knowledge of college football, college life and the grass roots evolution of politics that began in academia and now shapes the political aspects of our everyday life. This fast paced, biographical work contains layers of storyline with twists and turns that are poignant, and startling.Join three young men’s true stories as they launch themselves onto the college football scene and refuse to be denied their impact both on and off the field. These mistakenly overlooked college football players take over a struggling football team with their drive and motivation, all in an effort to rise to the challenge of one more football season. Living on the edge of college life as driven athletes, they face a dramatic conspiracy as they struggle in the face of athletic romance, real world politics of organizational behavior and creating their own futures as they are forced to lead the world around them much sooner than they ever expected.Heavy is the head that wears the crown as these extraordinary athletes have decisions to make that are crowded by circumstances that continually provide opportunities for them to fail in rising to the level of achievement that they know they have earned. Understanding their romantic interests and hearing their sex stories as they struggle not to be dragged under provides a highly insightful gaze into their world.The dynamics of college football, deciding on a future and motivation for achievement are illustrated here in a true story of the thin line between being an exceptional football player and the ever expanding world of claims that all performers are equal despite the results that prove to differentiate those same performers. At a new school, on a new team, joining the college ranks, these young men face more reality than they anticipated as they hold their future in their own hands and are first hand participants in the real world evolution of organizational politicking, power struggles and the freedom to pursue the college endeavor as they see fit. This true story is worth picking up simply to have an accurate overview of the inner workings and value of university education, college football and organizational manipulation. It serves as both a remarkable story of college life and as an instruction manual to the pitfalls of the people surrounding exceptional individuals, in addition to the political motivations of higher education organizations. College football, coaching motivations and the nature of organizational leaders is clearly depicted here as your guide.

Here is a rare opportunity to eavesdrop on two cinematic masters from very different backgrounds as they cover each of Hitch''s films in succession.

It''s difficult to think of a more informative or entertaining introduction to Hitchcock''s art, interests, and peculiar sense of humor. The book is a storehouse of insight and witticism, including the master''s impressions of a classic like Rear Window ("I was feeling very creative at the time, the batteries were well charged"), his technical insight into Psycho''s shower scene ("the knife never touched the body; it was all done in the [editing]"), and his ruminations on flops such as Under Capricorn ("If I were to make another picture in Australia today, I''d have a policeman hop into the pocket of a kangaroo and yell ''Follow that car!''").

    ('A founding member of Guns N’ Roses and Velvet Revolver shares the story of his rise to the pinnacle of fame and fortune, his struggles with alcoholism and drug addiction, his personal crash and burn, and his phoenix-like transformation via a unique path to sobriety. In 1984, at the age of twenty, Duff McKagan left his native Seattle—partly to pursue music but mainly to get away from a host of heroin overdoses then decimating his closest group of friends in the local punk scene. In L.A. only a few weeks and still living in his car, he answered a want ad for a bass player placed by someone who identified himself only as “Slash.” Soon after, the most dangerous band in the world was born. Guns N’ Roses went on to sell more than 100 million albums worldwide. In It''s So Easy, Duff recounts GN’R’s unlikely trajectory to a string of multiplatinum albums, sold-out stadium concerts, and global acclaim. But that kind of glory can take its toll, and it did—ultimately—on Duff, as well as on the band itself. As GN’R began to splinter, Duff felt that he himself was done, too. But his near death as a direct result of alcoholism proved to be his watershed, the turning point that led to his unique path to sobriety and the unexpected choices he has made for himself since.

He opens a window on his private life, from his boyhood dislike of school to his daughter’s precocious melancholy, from his successful struggle to quit smoking to his anxiety at the prospect of testifying against some clumsy muggers who fell upon him during a visit to New York City.

    ('On August 14, 1944, Lucien Carr, a friend of William S. Burroughs from St. Louis, stabbed a man named David Kammerer with a Boy Scout knife and threw his body in the Hudson River. For eight years, Kammerer had fawned over the younger Carr, but that night something happened: either Carr had had enough or he was forced to defend himself.The next day, his clothes stained with blood, Carr went to his friends Bill Burroughs and Jack Kerouac for help. Doing so, he involved them in the crime. A few months later, they were caught up in the crime in a different way. Something about the murder captivated the Beats, especially Kerouac and Burroughs, who decided to collaborate on a novel about the events of the previous summer. At the time, the two authors were still unknown, yet to write anything of note. Narrating alternating chapters, they pieced together a hard-boiled tale of bohemian New York during World War II, full of drugs and art, obsession and violence, with scenes and characters drawn from their own lives.They submitted their manuscript—called And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks after an absurd line from a radio bulletin about a circus fire—to publishers, but it was rejected and confined to a filing cabinet for decades. Finally published, at long last, And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks tells the story of Ramsay Allen and the object of his fixation, the charismatic, idealistic young Phillip Tourian. Phillip and his friends drink and dream in the bars and apartments of the West Village, until, with his friend Mike Ryko (Kerouac''s narrator), he hatches a plan to ship out as a merchant marine. They''ll catch a boat for France and jump ship, then make their way through the front to Paris. And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks is an engaging, fast-paced read that shows the two authors'' developing styles.

They are faced with new challenges, not just the ordinary trials of sheer survival, but the complications posed by many groups of people who need to live and work together.

He was, of course, speaking for his own generation, and a hundred years later the opinion may seem somewhat exaggerated. However, there is no doubt that The Old Wives'' Tale is a superb novel of its kind, and it is still as readable and enjoyable as ever. First published in 1908, it tells the story of the Baines sisters--shy, retiring Constance and defiant, romantic Sophia--over the course of nearly half a century. Bennett traces the lives of the sisters from childhood in their father''s drapery shop in provincial Bursley, England, during the mid-Victorian era, through their married lives, to the modern industrial age, when they are reunited as old women. The setting moves from the Five Towns of the Staffordshire Potteries to exotic and cosmopolitan Paris. It was fascinating to learn from Bennett''s journal how he saw an old lady in a cafe and was inspired to think of how her life might have been lived, how she must have once been young. The plot of the novel came to him fairly promptly, and, as they say, the rest is history.

Now they come to one of the most tumultuous eras of all: the enormous social, political, and economic turmoil of the 1960s through the 1980s, from civil rights, assassinations, mass political movements and Vietnam to the Berlin Wall, the Cuban Missile Crisis, presidential impeachment, revolution – and rock and roll.East German teacher Rebecca Hoffman discovers she’s been spied on by the Stasi for years and commits an impulsive act that will affect her family for the rest of their lives.…George Jakes, the child of a mixed-race couple, bypasses a corporate law career to join Robert F. Kennedy’s Justice Department, and finds himself in the middle not only of the seminal events of the civil rights battle, but a much more personal battle of his own.…Cameron Dewar, the grandson of a senator, jumps at the chance to do some official and unofficial espionage for a cause he believes in, only to discover that the world is a much more dangerous place than he’d imagined.…Dimka Dvorkin, a young aide to Nikita Khrushchev, becomes a prime agent both for good and for ill as the United States and the Soviet Union race to the brink of nuclear war, while his twin sister, Tania, carves out a role that will take her from Moscow to Cuba to Prague to Warsaw – and into history.As always with Follett, the historical background is brilliantly researched and rendered, the action fast-moving, the characters rich in nuance and emotion.

    ('Controversial indictment of those who exploit the tragedy of the Holocaust for their own gain.In an iconoclastic and controversial study, Norman G. Finkelstein moves from an interrogation of the place the Holocaust has come to occupy in American culture to a disturbing examination of recent Holocaust compensation agreements. It was not until the Arab-Israeli War of 1967, when Israel''s evident strength brought it into line with US foreign policy, that memory of the Holocaust began to acquire the exceptional prominence it enjoys today. Leaders of America''s Jewish community were delighted that Israel was now deemed a major strategic asset and, Finkelstein contends, exploited the Holocaust to enhance this newfound status. Their subsequent interpretations of the tragedy are often at variance with actual historical events and are employed to deflect any criticism of Israel and its supporters. Recalling Holocaust fraudsters such as Jerzy Kosinski and Binjamin Wilkomirski, as well as the demagogic constructions of writers like Daniel Goldhagen, Finkelstein contends that the main danger posed to the memory of Nazism''s victims comes not from the distortions of Holocaust deniers but from prominent, self-proclaimed guardians of Holocaust memory. Drawing on a wealth of untapped sources, he exposes the double shakedown of European countries as well as legitimate Jewish claimants, and concludes that the Holocaust industry has become an outright extortion racket. Thoroughly researched and closely argued, The Holocaust Industry is all the more disturbing and powerful because the issues it deals with are so rarely discussed.In a devastating new postscript to this best-selling book, Norman G. Finkelstein documents the Holocaust industry''s scandalous cover-up of the blackmail of Swiss banks, and in a new appendix demolishes an influential apologia for the Holocaust industry.','Second Edition','Paperback','9.78186E+12',288,4.05,1642,'The Holocaust Industry: Reflections on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1386924294l/48836.jpg','b1174',46.89),

One day he was a doctor treating the dying, and the next he was a patient struggling to live. And just like that, the future he and his wife had imagined evaporated. When Breath Becomes Air chronicles Kalanithi’s transformation from a naïve medical student “possessed,” as he wrote, “by the question of what, given that all organisms die, makes a virtuous and meaningful life” into a neurosurgeon at Stanford working in the brain, the most critical place for human identity, and finally into a patient and new father confronting his own mortality.What makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you do when the future, no longer a ladder toward your goals in life, flattens out into a perpetual present? What does it mean to have a child, to nurture a new life as another fades away?

He conceived of the four parts–The Stories of Jacob, Young Joseph, Joseph in Egypt, and Joseph the Provider–as a unified narrative, a “mythological novel” of Joseph’s fall into slavery and his rise to be lord over Egypt. Deploying lavish, persuasive detail, Mann conjures for us the world of patriarchs and pharaohs, the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Palestine, and the universal force of human love in all its beauty, desperation, absurdity, and pain. The result is a brilliant amalgam of humor, emotion, psychological insight, and epic grandeur.Now the award-winning translator John E.

A lifelong disability, or a naturally occurring form of cognitive difference akin to certain forms of genius? In truth, it is all of these things and more—and the future of our society depends on our understanding it. WIRED reporter Steve Silberman unearths the secret history of autism, long suppressed by the same clinicians who became famous for discovering it, and finds surprising answers to the crucial question of why the number of diagnoses has soared in recent years.   Going back to the earliest days of autism research and chronicling the brave and lonely journey of autistic people and their families through the decades, Silberman provides long-sought solutions to the autism puzzle, while mapping out a path for our society toward a more humane world in which people with learning differences and those who love them have access to the resources they need to live happier, healthier, more secure, and more meaningful lives.   Along the way, he reveals the untold story of Hans Asperger, the father of Asperger’s syndrome, whose “little professors” were targeted by the darkest social-engineering experiment in human history; exposes the covert campaign by child psychiatrist Leo Kanner to suppress knowledge of the autism spectrum for fifty years; and casts light on the growing movement of "neurodiversity" activists seeking respect, support, technological innovation, accommodations in the workplace and in education, and the right to self-determination for those with cognitive differences.','First Edition (U.S.)','Hardcover','9.78158E+12',477,4.3,6362,'NeuroTribes: The Legacy of Autism and the Future of Neurodiversity','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1421707890l/22514020.jpg','b1241',30.89),

It was to last five years and transform him from an amiable and somewhat aimless young man into a scientific celebrity. Even more vitally, it was to set in motion the intellectual currents that culminated in the arrival of The Origin of Species in Victorian drawing-rooms in 1859. His journal, reprinted here in a shortened version, is vivid and immediate, showing us a naturalist making patient observations, above all in geology. As well as a profusion of natural history detail, it records many other things that caught Darwin’s eye, from civil war in Argentina to the new colonial settlements of Australia.

Alone and untethered, feeling lost in the country he had come to regard as home, Hans stumbles upon the vibrant New York subculture of cricket, where he revisits his lost childhood and, thanks to a friendship with a charismatic and charming Trinidadian named Chuck Ramkissoon, begins to reconnect with his life and his adopted country.

Una storia d''amore appassionata, imperfetta come gli amori veri.Ma anche la storia di una maternità cercata, negata, risarcita. Il cammino misterioso di una nascita che fa piazza pulita della scienza, della biologia, e si addentra nella placenta preistorica di una Guerra che mentre uccide procrea.In questo grande affresco di tenebra e luce, in questo romanzo intimo e sociale, le voci di quei ragazzi si accordano e si frantumano nel continuo rimando tra il ventre di Gemma e il ventre della città dilaniata. Ma l''avventura di Gemma e Diego è anche la storia di tutti noi, perché Margaret Mazzantini ha scritto un coraggioso romanzo contemporaneo.

His poems of ecstatic identification with the world exert a seemingly endless fascination for contemporary readers.In Stephen Mitchell’s versions, many readers feel that they have discovered an English rendering that captures the lyric intensity, fluency, and reach of Rilke’s poetry more accurately and convincingly than has ever been done before.Mr. Mitchell is impeccable in his adherence to Rilke’s text, to his formal music, and to the complexity of his thought; at the same time, his work has authority and power as poetry in its own right.

Cooper in Penguin Classics.With neither friends nor family, Lucy Snowe sets sail from England to find employment in a girls'' boarding school in the small town of Villette. There, she struggles to retain her self-possession in the face of unruly pupils, the hostility of headmistress Madame Beck, and her own complex feelings - first for the school''s English doctor and then for the dictatorial professor Paul Emanuel. Drawing on her own deeply unhappy experiences as a governess in Brussels, Charlotte Brontë''sautobiographical novel, the last published during her lifetime, is a powerfully moving study of loneliness and isolation, and the pain of unrequited love, narrated by a heroine determined to preserve an independent spirit in the face of adverse circumstances.Helen M. Cooper''s new introduction places the novel in the context of Brontë''s life and career and argues for the importance of the novel as an exploration of imperialism.Charlotte Brontë (1816-55), eldest of the Brontë sisters, was born in Thornton, West Yorkshire. Jane Eyre was first published in 1847 under the pen-name Currer Bell, and was followed by Shirley (1848) and Vilette (1853).

    ('La mort est mon métier sont les pseudo-mémoires de Rudolf Höß (renommé Rudolf Lang dans l''ouvrage). Rudolf Höß était le commandant du camp de concentration et d''extermination d''Auschwitz pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale.L''histoire commence en 1913 alors que Rudolf Lang a 13 ans.Il reçoit une éducation catholique mal comprise et très normative. Son père, un commerçant, ayant reçu une éducation militaire (famille militaire), totalement psychorigide, qui a commis un péché dans sa jeunesse à Paris et avec qui il entretient des rapports tendus, veut qu''il devienne prêtre pour expier les fautes que lui-même a commises. Rudolf croit en Dieu, jusqu''au jour où, en se battant avec un de ses camarades d''école (Werner), il lui casse la jambe. Immédiatement, il va se confesser à un prêtre. Le soir même, son père devient fou de rage après avoir appris que son fils a commis un « péché » sans lui en parler. Rudolf se sent trahi par le prêtre, seule personne au courant de l''épisode, les autres croyant à un accident. Or, on apprendra que c''est en fait le père de l''enfant blessé qui s''est plaint devant une assemblée de parents d''élèves. Le mal est fait : Rudolf ne croit plus en Dieu. Son père meurt peu avant la déclaration de guerre en 1914.À seize ans, Lang débute sa carrière militaire, d''abord en partant directement pour le front Ouest où il sera intercepté puis renvoyé à l''arrière car il est trop jeune, puis comme aide à l''hôpital militaire où il rencontrera un dragon de cavalerie qui le persuadera de rentrer dans son unité et de partir sur le front en Turquie.À la fin de la guerre, il se retrouve au chômage, rejeté par sa famille. Il s''apprête à se suicider lorsqu''un de ses collègues arrive et lui brandit un tract en lui disant de ne pas trahir l''Allemagne en se donnant la mort.Il adhère au parti nazi et se voit confier la direction d''une ferme avec sa femme Elsie, où il vit des journées de dur labeur, mais paisibles. Puis, après la prise du pouvoir par Hitler, il entre dans les SS, n''ayant pourtant pas les critères requis pour y adhérer. Il accède à des fonctions de plus en plus importantes dans la hiérarchie SS, jusqu''à devenir commandant du camp d''Auschwitz. Ce camp, d''abord de concentration, puis d''extermination, devient le lieu de la lente et tâtonnante mise au point de l''Usine de Mort du village d''Auschwitz. Il y reçoit l''ordre du Reichsführer Himmler de supprimer 500 000 unités par an au lieu des ridicules 80 000 unités de Treblinka. Lang va s''attacher à accomplir la mission qui lui a été assignée : tuer le plus grand nombre de Juifs et éliminer le plus efficacement possible les cadavres. Après la guerre et la chute d''Hitler, il est emprisonné, puis condamné à la pendaison après son procès où il affirmera avoir seulement suivi les ordres, indiquant d''un air naturel qu''il a supervisé et participé activement au meurtre de « seulement » 2,5 millions de personnes au lieu des 3,5 millions prévus3.Tout au long du livre, il se montre incapable de sentiments et même d''action personnelle, car sa conduite lui a toujours été dictée par un chef en qui il portait une confiance totale. À la fin, on le sent cependant en colère se disant trahi par Himmler, qui, tel un lâche, s''est suicidé, et n''a ainsi pas voulu assumer son rôle dans l''extermination des Juifs, laissant Rudolf seul responsable de ses actes. Jusqu''au bout, il assume cependant son idée du chef, en répétant froidement et méthodiquement qu''il est le seul responsable de ce qui s''est passé à Auschwitz, et en énonçant sans difficulté les atrocités commises. Son seul moment de doute survient lorsque sa femme apprend ses activités, mais, ayant été choisi pour ses rares qualités de conscience il n''accorde pas d''importance à la morale.','Folio','Mass Market Paperback','9.78207E+12',369,4.34,3393,'La Mort est mon métier','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1413128510l/94498.jpg','b1293',32.63),

Though many have tried to replicate Stoker''s horror classic—in books, television shows, and movies—only the 1931 Bela Lugosi film bore the Stoker family''s support. Until now. Dracula The Un-Dead is a bone-chilling sequel based on Bram Stoker''s own handwritten notes for characters and plot threads excised from the original edition. Dracula The Un-Dead begins in 1912, twenty-five years after Dracula "crumbled into dust." Van Helsing''s protégé, Dr. Jack Seward, is now a disgraced morphine addict obsessed with stamping out evil across Europe. Meanwhile, an unknowing Quincey Harker, the grown son of Jonathan and Mina, leaves law school for the London stage, only to stumble upon the troubled production of "Dracula," directed and produced by Bram Stoker himself.  The play plunges Quincey into the world of his parents'' terrible secrets, but before he can confront them he experiences evil in a way he had never imagined. One by one, the band of heroes that defeated Dracula a quarter-century ago is being hunted down. Could it be that Dracula somehow survived their attack and is seeking revenge? Or is there another force at work whose relentless purpose is to destroy anything and anyone associated with Dracula? Dracula The Un-Dead is deeply researched, rich in character, thrills and scares, and lovingly crafted as both an extension and celebration of one of the most classic popular novels in literature.','First Edition','Hardcover','9.78053E+12',424,3.11,4766,'Dracula the Un-Dead','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1426481613l/6420652.jpg','b1296',15.76),

Charles Palliser unfolds an epic story of murder, disinheritance, and deception that knits all levels of English society together in a mesmerizing, intricately crafted plot.Searching for clues to his origins, John Huffam, a young man from the north of England, comes to believe that he is the victim of a vast and ancient conspiracy, and that only by claiming his mystery-enshrouded birthright can he escape it.His quest for the truth draws him from the remote countryside of his childhood into the violent and corrupt London underworld of the Late Regency—a world of poverty and fear for many, of fabulous wealth and luxury for the few. Here John finds that nothing is safe from the laws of supply and demand—the living and the dead, loyalty, friendship, and even justice itself.Each time he believes that he has eluded the conspiracy, its tentacles seem to entrap him and those dearest to him, destroying them or turning them against him.

A well-behaved, gifted student, she didn''t arrive home after school and her divorced mother is frantic. Bernie is quick to take the case -- something about a cash flow problem that Chet''s not all that clear about -- and he''s relieved, if vaguely suspicious, when Madison turns up unharmed with a story that doesn''t add up.

But at the same time, there arises an undercurrent of feeling that something is missing-a quality of intimacy.This quality has very little to do with the physical, though sex is certainly one possible door. Far more important is a willingness to expose our deepest feelings and vulnerabilities, with the trust that the other person will treat them with care. Ultimately, the willingness to take the risk of intimacy has to be grounded in an inner strength that knows that even if the other remains closed, even if that trust is betrayed, we will not suffer any permanent damage.In this gentle and compassionate guide, Osho takes his readers step-by-step through what makes people afraid of intimacy, how to encounter those fears and go beyond them, and what they can do to nourish themselves and their relationships to support more openness and trust.OSHO challenges readers to examine and break free of the conditioned belief systems and prejudices that limit their capacity to life in all its richness.

There he discovers the history of the tempestuous events that took place years before; of the intense relationship between the gypsy foundling Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw; and how Catherine, forced to choose between passionate, tortured Heathcliff and gentle, well-bred Edgar Linton, surrendered to the expectations of her class. As Heathcliff''s bitterness and vengeance at his betrayal is visited upon the next generation, their innocent heirs must struggle to escape the legacy of the past.Emily Brontë''s only novel, a work of tremendous and far-reaching influence, the Penguin Classics edition of Wuthering Heights is the definitive edition of the text, edited with an introduction by Pauline Nestor. In this edition, a new preface by Lucasta Miller, author of The Brontë Myth, looks at the ways in which the novel has been interpreted, from Charlotte Brontë onwards. This complements Pauline Nestor''s introduction, which discusses changing critical receptions of the novel, as well as Emily Brontë''s influences and background.Emily Brontë (1818-48), along with her sisters, Charlotte and Anne, was one of the most significant literary figures of the 19th century. She wrote just one strikingly innovative novel, Wuthering Heights, but was also a gifted and intense poet.''Wuthering Heights is commonly thought of as "romantic", but try rereading it without being astonished by the comfortableness with which Brontë''s characters subject one another to extremes of physical and psychological violence''Jeanette Winterson''As a first novel, there is very little that can compare to it.

    ('A penetrating, page-turning tour of a post-human EarthIn The World Without Us, Alan Weisman offers an utterly original approach to questions of humanity''s impact on the planet: he asks us to envision our Earth, without us.In this far-reaching narrative, Weisman explains how our massive infrastructure would collapse and finally vanish without human presence; which everyday items may become immortalized as fossils; how copper pipes and wiring would be crushed into mere seams of reddish rock; why some of our earliest buildings might be the last architecture left; and how plastic, bronze sculpture, radio waves, and some man-made molecules may be our most lasting gifts to the universe.The World Without Us reveals how, just days after humans disappear, floods in New York''s subways would start eroding the city''s foundations, and how, as the world''s cities crumble, asphalt jungles would give way to real ones. It describes the distinct ways that organic and chemically treated farms would revert to wild, how billions more birds would flourish, and how cockroaches in unheated cities would perish without us. Drawing on the expertise of engineers, atmospheric scientists, art conservators, zoologists, oil refiners, marine biologists, astrophysicists, religious leaders from rabbis to the Dali Lama, and paleontologists---who describe a prehuman world inhabited by megafauna like giant sloths that stood taller than mammoths---Weisman illustrates what the planet might be like today, if not for us.From places already devoid of humans (a last fragment of primeval European forest; the Korean DMZ; Chernobyl), Weisman reveals Earth''s tremendous capacity for self-healing. As he shows which human devastations are indelible, and which examples of our highest art and culture would endure longest, Weisman''s narrative ultimately drives toward a radical but persuasive solution that needn''t depend on our demise. It is narrative nonfiction at its finest, and in posing an irresistible concept with both gravity and a highly readable touch, it looks deeply at our effects on the planet in a way that no other book has.','First Edition','Hardcover','9.78031E+12',324,3.8,33066,'The World Without Us','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1441986417l/248787.jpg','b1402',44.72),

    ('The Teutonic Knights is an epic of medieval times and national destiny, ranking as one of the highest achievements from the pen of Henryk Sienkiewicz, the Nobel Prize winner for Literature in 1905. The novel follows the adventures of Macko, a resourceful and wise veteran of war, and his young nephew, Zbyszko, the symbol of a maturing nation, as they struggle, along with the unified peoples of Poland and Lithuania, against the oppressive religious military order, the Teutonic Knights. Among the many memorable characters are Jurand, a merciless, bitter fighter consumed with revenge; his daughter, the innocent Danusia, a girl of twelve who must face the barbarity of the German knighthood; the strong-willed Jagienka, equally adept at shooting a crossbow or administering an estate; Hlawa, a Czech squire of noble birth who is as quick with his wit as he is with his axe; Sanderus, a peddler of religious relics and indulgences whose earthly cravings seem greater than any spiritual needs. A host of other memorable characters fills the canvas set against lush, almost magical forests, dangerous marshes replete with tales of human heads walking on spider legs, winter blizzards that blanket the world in a white wonderland - all at once beautiful and foreboding. Splendid castles are described here, court hunts, single combats that test valor and strength. The customs of knights with their code of honor and feelings of love are adroitly explored. The entirety culminates in one of the most important battles in medieval history, the Battle of Grunwald. The Teutonic Knights was published in America in 1900 in various competing translations of erratic quality. Not until 1943 did a translation worthy of this masterpiece appear, but unfortunately its release was limited to Great Britain. It is this translation that has been revised and edited by Miroslaw Lipinski with an eye for both fluidity in the English language and fidelity to the original Polish.','Illustrated Edition','Hardcover','9.78078E+12',786,3.35,3810,'The Teutonic Knights','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1387715014l/759212.jpg','b1404',35.89),

    ('From John Robbins, a new edition of the classic that awakened the conscience of a nation. Since the 1987 publication of Diet for a New America, beef consumption in the United States has fallen a remarkable 19%. While many forces are contributing to this dramatic shift in our habits, Diet for a New America is considered to be one of the most important. Diet for a New America is a startling examination of the food we currently buy and eat in the United States, and the astounding moral, economic, and emotional price we pay for it.In Section I, John Robbins takes an extraordinary look at our dependence on animals for food and the inhumane conditions under which these animals are raised. It becomes clear that the price we pay for our eating habits is measured in the suffering of animals, a suffering so extreme and needless that it disrupts our very place in the web of life.Section II challenges the belief that consuming meat is a requirement for health by pointing our the vastly increased rate of disease caused by pesticides, hormones, additives, and other chemicals now a routine part of our food production. The author shows us that the high health risk is unnecessary, and that the production, preparation, and consumption of food can once again be a healthy process.In Section III, Robbins looks at the global implications of a meat-based diet and concludes that the consumption of the resources necessary to produce meat is a major factor in our ecological crisis.Diet for a New America is the single most eloquent argument for a vegetarian lifestyle ever published.

    ('In this epic, beautifully written masterwork, Pulitzer Prize–winning author Isabel Wilkerson chronicles one of the great untold stories of American history: the decades-long migration of black citizens who fled the South for northern and western cities, in search of a better life. From 1915 to 1970, this exodus of almost six million people changed the face of America. Wilkerson compares this epic migration to the migrations of other peoples in history. She interviewed more than a thousand people, and gained access to new data and official records, to write this definitive and vividly dramatic account of how these American journeys unfolded, altering our cities, our country, and ourselves.With stunning historical detail, Wilkerson tells this story through the lives of three unique individuals: Ida Mae Gladney, who in 1937 left sharecropping and prejudice in Mississippi for Chicago, where she achieved quiet blue-collar success and, in old age, voted for Barack Obama when he ran for an Illinois Senate seat; sharp and quick-tempered George Starling, who in 1945 fled Florida for Harlem, where he endangered his job fighting for civil rights, saw his family fall, and finally found peace in God; and Robert Foster, who left Louisiana in 1953 to pursue a medical career, the personal physician to Ray Charles as part of a glitteringly successful medical career, which allowed him to purchase a grand home where he often threw exuberant parties.Wilkerson brilliantly captures their first treacherous and exhausting cross-country trips by car and train and their new lives in colonies that grew into ghettos, as well as how they changed these cities with southern food, faith, and culture and improved them with discipline, drive, and hard work. Both a riveting microcosm and a major assessment, The Warmth of Other Suns is a bold, remarkable, and riveting work, a superb account of an “unrecognized immigration” within our own land.

    (' In 2005, two tragedies--the Asian tsunami and Hurricane Katrina--turned CNN reporter Anderson Cooper into a media celebrity. Dispatches from the Edge, Cooper''s memoir of "war, disasters and survival," is a brief but powerful chronicle of Cooper''s ascent to stardom and his struggle with his own tragedies and demons. Cooper was 10 years old when his father, Wyatt Cooper, died during heart bypass surgery. He was 20 when his beloved older brother, Carter, committed suicide by jumping off his mother''s penthouse balcony (his mother, by the way, being Gloria Vanderbilt). The losses profoundly affected Cooper, who fled home after college to work as a freelance journalist for Channel One, the classroom news service. Covering tragedies in far-flung places like Burma, Vietnam, and Somalia, Cooper quickly learned that "as a journalist, no matter ... how respectful you are, part of your brain remains focused on how to capture the horror you see, how to package it, present it to others." Cooper''s description of these horrors, from war-ravaged Baghdad to famine-wracked Niger, is poignant but surprisingly unsentimental. In Niger, Cooper writes, he is chagrined, then resigned, when he catches himself looking for the "worst cases" to commit to film. "They die, I live. It''s the way of the world," he writes. In the final section of Dispatches, Cooper describes covering Hurricane Katrina, the story that made him famous. The transcript of his showdown with Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu (in which Cooper tells Landrieu people in New Orleans are "ashamed of what is happening in this country right now") is worth the price of admission on its own. Cooper''s memoir leaves some questions unanswered--there''s frustratingly little about his personal life, for example--but remains a vivid, modest self-portrait by a man who is proving himself to be an admirable, courageous leader in a medium that could use more like him. --Erica C.

    ('“Liberals seem to have hit upon a reverse Christ story as their belief system. He suffered and died for our sins; liberals make the rest of us suffer for sins we didn’t commit.”Who are the victims here? To hear liberals tell it, you’d think they do nothing but suffer at the hands of ruthless entities like the “Republican Attack Machine” and Fox News.Really?It’s just another instance of the Big Lie, of course, told so often that some people have actually started to believe it. In Guilty, Ann Coulter explodes this myth to reveal that when it comes to bullying, no one outdoes the Left. Citing case after case, ranging from the hilariously absurd to the shockingly vicious, Coulter dissects these so-called victims who are invariably the oppressors. For instance:•Single mothers: Getting pregnant isn’t like catching the flu. There are volitional acts involved–someone else explain it to Dennis Kucinich. By this purposeful act, single mothers cause irreparable harm to other human beings–their own children–as countless studies on the subject make clear.•The myth of the Republican Attack Machine: The most amazing thing liberals have done is create the myth of a compliant right-wing media with Republicans badgering baffled reporters into attacking Democrats. It’s so mad, it’s brilliant. It’s one kind of lie to say the Holocaust occurred when the Swedes killed the Jews. But it’s another kind of lie entirely to say the Holocaust occurred when the Jews killed the Nazis.•“Brave” liberals: In addition to being beautiful, compassionate tribunes of the downtrodden, liberals are brave. I know that because they’re always telling me how brave they are. Why, five nights a week, MSNBC’s Keith Olbermann courageously books guests who completely agree with him. It doesn’t get much braver than that.•Obambi’s luck: While B. Hussein Obama piously condemned attacks on candidates’ ­families, his media and campaign surrogates ripped open the court-sealed divorce records of his two principal opponents in his Senate race in Illinois.•The offenders are offended!: Republican senator George Allen’s career was destroyed when he made a joking remark to a privileged Indian American harassing him at campaign stops. When did rich kids become a new protected category that must be shielded from words that are insulting in other languages? How did Sidarth become a specially anointed victim? What did we ever do to India? And why didn’t we ever hear about the far more offensive anti-Semitic flyers of Allen’s opponent Jim Webb?One essential and recurring truth about self-righteous liberals, says Coulter, is that “they viciously attack all while wailing that they are the true victims.” With Guilty–a mordantly witty and shockingly specific catalog of offenses that liberals would rather we ignore and forget–Ann Coulter presents exhibits A through Z.From the Hardcover edition.','Large Print','Paperback','9.78074E+12',496,3.59,2344,'Guilty: Liberal "Victims" and Their Assault on America','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320400867l/6076107.jpg','b1458',20.16),

    ('"A fable for grownups who believe it is never too late to change."Don''t let the illustrations fool you; Loss De Plott is as thought provoking as it gets. A fable for grownups, who believe it is never too late to change and understand the power of now, Loss will re-ignite your hunger for answers and will take you on a journey of discovery, where the stakes could not be higher.A chilling view of the future unfolds as the boundaries of time unravel and characters that might well shape our future are revealed. Meet Slothman, Wordsmith and the haunting Dark Whisperers and you will learn that it really is never too late to change.Myers has created a truly unique blending of illustrations and words, in a book that is impossible to put down. Written with a Dickensian lilt and the cadence of a musical score; the tale is told by a mysterious narrator who wakes, without his memory, only to find the elfin like Loss levitating before him."What ......does it look like," she asks. And when a parade of odd looking doors appear in his mind he realizes that, if he is to resolve the mystery of his peculiar circumstances, there are answers he must find. Thus begins a fable that, by revealing what is really important in life, might well change your view of the world forever.Simple, yet deceptively complex, fragments of this endearing fable can be found in literature, religions and philosophies across the centuries. Yet, when all is said and done, they come down to one solitary word. A word that has both the power to create; the power to destroy the world of tomorrow and upon which rests the future of children everywhere.In the words of Stephan J Myers......Even in this digital age there is no diary we might consult more than that of memory and it often seems to me that the oldest of memories linger longest for the dreams that never die. Constant whispers that remind us all of those halcyon days of youth, when the great expectations for our lives ahead were yet untainted by the realities of life.That everything changes is perhaps the most enduring of universal truths. Yet even that for which we have most longed might often be tinged by sadness, for fundamental to change are the choices we must make. With the years I have come to realise that each step we take in life might be regretted once we begin to dwell upon those other steps we might have taken. More, there seems to me a time for each of us when we might ask what if?Loss De Plott is above all the sum of those choices we might make. Unashamedly written with a Dickensian lilt and some rather quirky illustrations I wanted to write a book which the reader could not skim across the pages, but be encouraged to find an accord between images and words. Both mediums layered upon each other with the greatest of care, that they might reflect the simplicity and complexity with which we weave the patterns of our lives. More, I want you to never forget the characters Loss meets on her travels. The gross Slothman, the devilish Teller Of Tales and of course the Whisperers In The Dark.Find the rhythm in the words and reach once again for those halcyon days of youth. So that we might never forget we are each and every one of us the stuff of dreams and though we might be grownups, it is never too late to change.Stephan J Myers, July 2012.','Black & White illustration.','Paperback','9.78096E+12',86,4.31,35,'Loss De Plott','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1342102501l/15748083.jpg','b1510',22.58),

There he can find the discipline he needs and the answers he seeks, but getting him there alive will be anything but easy. Yareli is not the only one searching for the Scargen boy. Along his journey, Thomas will ride atop a teleport dragon, duel a High Demon of the Depths, run with the Lions of Sirati, outfox a spirit ghost, race a vampire, and quote Shakespeare with a whiskey-swilling werewolf—all the hope of discovering the truth about his father. This quest will be fraught with darkness and malevolence far more unyielding than anything Thomas has come across in his fantasy books. Armed with his newly realized powers and his unlikely companions, Thomas Scargen will have to face this pervasive evil without being entirely consumed by The Shadow of the Gauntlet.

And, ultimately, what is the meaning of life for them?In this book our fellow global nomads, travelers who wander the world without a permanent job or home, answer these intriguing questions. They are modern-day adventurers and vagrants, no one''s property.Global nomads value freedom and mastery of their own lives. Their ideas draw from the everyday life and dreams of explorers, philosophers, and vagrants, some notable pioneers including Alexander the Great, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and George Orwell.This book shows how global nomads revive the ancient ideals of a simple and beautiful life.

Dozens of maps provide a clear geography of great events, while timelines give the reader an ongoing sense of the passage of years and cultural interconnection.

    ('"If Faust were a 21st century metal-minded former punk with too much libido and a major attitude problem, this would be her story."KIRKUS REVIEWIn Eggenberger’s debut novel, an aging heavy-metal music fan and aspiring writer sells her soul to the devil and finds there’s a lot more to life than good and evil.The novel’s unnamed, Scandinavian narrator has long enjoyed the freedom of being an unattached, self-described “nympho slut” and “metalhead.” However, she struggles to find time to write between shifts at her day job, and as she approaches her 47th birthday, she begins to worry that her writing career may never take off the way she’d planned and that her steady stream of young one-night stands may soon dry up. One day, as she steals a few hours to write in a Copenhagen coffee shop, a dead ringer for her favorite metal musician approaches her. She recognizes him, not as the rock icon he resembles, but as the devil himself. He offers her the promise of the writing career—and love life—she’s always dreamed of in exchange for her soul, but she’s reluctant. The devil is not accustomed to hearing “no,” and so he instead persuades her to help him destroy his wife, the biblical Lilith, before she destroys the world. As the tough-as-nails narrator’s sultry romance with the devil begins and her writing career skyrockets toward celebrity status, she finds that the real world is a lot more nuanced than the one purported by so-called moralists. The novel has distinct, well-developed feminist undertones and proves to be about much more than a powerful woman destroying another powerful woman. Fans of the long-esteemed feminist heroine Lilith may be disappointed to see her as the villain here, but she proves to be an antagonist of Maleficent-esque proportions, and readers may be torn between fearing and loving her character. Feminist readers may also be pleased to see that the tomboy narrator ultimately finds camaraderie with a well-researched group of legendary women, including the Norse goddess, Freya, and her handmaiden Fulla.An engaging, modern-day Faust for brainy rockers.Pub Date:Dec. 17th, 2013ISBN:978-0991105908Page count:610ppPublisher:Nigel''s FlightProgram:Kirkus IndieReview Posted Online:Feb. 12th, 2014','1st','Hardcover','9.78099E+12',610,4.6,10,'Quantum Demonology','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1385742455l/19045334.jpg','b1542',32.8),

    ('"Gaza Writes Back: Short Stories from Young Writers in Gaza, Palestine", edited by Refaat Alareer is a compelling collection of short stories from fifteen young writers in Gaza, members of a generation that has suffered immensely under Israel’s siege and blockade. Their experiences, especially during and following Israel’s 2008-2009 offensive known as “Operation Cast Lead”, have fundamentally impacted their lives and their writing. Indeed, many of these writers saw the war as a catalyst for their writing, as they sought an outlet and a voice in its aftermath. They view the book as a means of preserving Palestinian memories and presenting their own narratives to the world without filters. Their words take us into the homes and hearts of moms, dads, students, children, and elders striving to live lives of dignity, compassion, and meaning in one of the world’s most embattled communities. (Some of the stories also take us with courage and empathy into the imagined world of Israelis living just on the other side of the great barriers Israel has built in and around Gaza and the West Bank to wall the Palestinians in.) These stories are acts of resistance and defiance, proclaiming the endurance of Palestinians and the continuing resilience and creativity of their culture in the face of ongoing obstacles and attempts to silence them. Whether tackling the tragedy that surrounds missile strikes and home raids, or the everyday indignities encountered by Palestinian refugees, Gaza Writes Back brings to life the real issues that the people of Gaza face. One prominent theme in many of the stories is the value placed on the wisdom of parents and grandparents. A sense of longing pervades the book, as the characters in the stories reveal desires ranging from the mundane to the complex—including, in several of the stories, a strong yearning to return to the characters’ long-cherished family homes and properties after many decades in exile from them. Social differences within Gaza are also sensitively explored. A few stories are especially difficult—but critical—to digest , for the vividness with which they depict the experiences of victims of Israeli military strikes and confront the legacy of violence and occupation, particularly on young people.Readers will be moved by the struggles big and small that emerge from the well-crafted writing by these young people, and by the hope and courage that radiates from the authors’ biographies. The contributors are university students and recent graduates, Palestinians who have chosen to speak out in their second language, which is an “expressive way to be more creative in a world where words are significantly mighty,” according to Tasnim Hamouda. Another contributor, Nour El Borno, believes “that if a person can write effectively, it is his or her duty to get up, write, and help change this world to something better.” Five years after Operation Cast Lead, these stories remind us that the pain lingers on and the people of Gaza will be forever scarred by the attack. Yet, the call for justice remains forceful and persistent, and these young Gazan writers refuse to let the world forget about them—their land, their people, and their story.','first edition','Paperback','9.78194E+12',208,4.25,152,'Gaza Writes Back (#1)','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1383643253l/18754110.jpg','b1548',10.76),

    ('ORION CONNECTION is the first installment in the Legends Trilogy. Inspired by the Face on Mars and the unexplainable technological marvels that predate the rise of Egypt by thousands of years, S DeGiorgio offers an eerily plausible connection between Mars and the rise of modern civilization. This novel is rocket fuel for people seeking answers to the question, “Are we alone?” It’s 2050, Earth’s resources are nearly gone, and armies guard what precious little remains. As mankind prepares to set foot on Mars, leaders of an ancient society are forced out of the shadows to protect secrets they’ve guarded for millennia. Orion’s crew gets caught in the middle, and on the eve of Earth’s first manned mission to Mars, unknown adversaries murder four of their own. As the reserve team is pressed into service, fears grow that co-conspirators may be on board. No one’s ever gone farther than the moon. Rumor and espionage threaten to tear the crew apart at a time when America can’t afford to fail, and they only have each other, elite training, and raw instincts to rely on. Not everyone believes they will make it home. Some even consider them expendable—acceptable losses to advance the cause. Control of Mars’ mineral rights will reestablish America’s position as the leader of the free world. Standing down is not an option—but we’re not the only country in the race for the red planet. “This story kept me spellbound and on the edge of my seat! I have been reading non-stop all day and just couldn’t put it down. Now I have to wait for the next book, which I hope is out soon.

    ('International Number 1 bestselling author Daniel M. Harrison portrays the modern millennial psyche like no other author has ever before. In The Millennial Reincarnations, the young minds of today are not just infused by the fast-paced, always-on economy of things, but they themselves are parts of the fabric of our changing environment. Specifically, Harrison imagines today''s young millennials as the reincarnated technology that drives our spiritual goals, needs, wants, aspirations and desires. The author expounds upon this theme in 70,000 words of fiction to explore the effect of technology upon the spiritual core of us all.The Millennial Reincarnations is Daniel M. Harrison''s latest masterpiece, construed as a novel in 3 parts: Body, Face and Soul. The narrative arc spans the years 1990-2014, taking in almost the entire Millennial era, during which the previously gradual adoption of artificially-orchestrated and influenced values and the associated technologically-infused processes of thinking has been rising at its steepest incline ever. Harrison considers in compelling and jaw-dropping prose some of the furthest-reaching effects on society as a whole of this trend.The Millennial Reincarnations is the composition of what amount to an inter-related series of stories that take place from within this 14 year period in New York City and in Shanghai, China. When two young girls are killed in a violent car accident, they have no idea that, unbeknownst to them, the reaction of a child star in the car in front who dies on the operating table in the hospital will set in motion events that bring about the next twenty years of economic upheaval and prosperity and define their individual and collective destinies.For the rapid reincarnation of their young souls is the direct result of the high-tech advancements society is making at the time they die, which, in speeding up cognitive function, in theory will allow less rested minds to adapt to their new bodies much more quickly. However, when formed inside bodies the young girls'' souls appear at times partial and fragmented, as if hardly able to remain complete in the one body they inhabit. Although materially rich and socially popular, their minds suffer from chemical addictions and emotional dependencies as a result of their spiritual afflictions, which had no time to rest before returning to relive under the weight of the earth.Ultimately, the author uses this premise to set in motion a series of catalytic events that chime with the real world in which we live as well as to explore in greater depth the psychological ramifications of a whole generation raised on excess material wealth, social agendas, individualistic points of view commingled with greater societal ideals and views on money as an object to be mastered and used - not needed - which permeates so many juvenile Millennial societies today.In The Millennial Reincarnations, Harrison returns to the big picture issues of wealth and poverty, life and death, money and war, with more powerful prose and stylistic twists than ever before. The author packs every one of the 12 chapters in the book with a moving and thrilling series of events and a twist right at the very end that you won''t see coming.This is an incredible, eye-opening, and moving read - cinematic in the execution Harrison delivers in capturing the whole world within 300 pages. Already being muttered about in the elite literary circles of London and New York as a potential candidate for the Great Millennial Novel, The Millennial Reincarnations will stay with you long after you have turned the last page. A tremendous work of fiction by a masterful author who has been described as "brilliant" by Jeffrey Robinson and "easily the best" by the Huffington Post''s Azeem Khan.','First Edition (1)','Paperback','9.78151E+12',297,3.86,37,'The Millennial Reincarnations','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1441078346l/26203460.jpg','b1591',9.5),

    ('Tolstoy''s epic novel of love, destiny and self-destruction, in a gorgeous new clothbound edition from Penguin Classics. Anna Karenina seems to have everything - beauty, wealth, popularity and an adored son. But she feels that her life is empty until the moment she encounters the impetuous officer Count Vronsky. Their subsequent affair scandalizes society and family alike and soon brings jealously and bitterness in its wake. Contrasting with this tale of love and self-destruction is the vividly observed story of Levin, a man striving to find contentment and a meaning to his life - and also a self-portrait of Tolstoy himself. This acclaimed modern translation by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky won the PEN/ Book of the Month Club Translation Prize in 2001. Their translation is accompanied in this edition by an introduction by Richard Pevear and a preface by John Bayley. "The new and brilliantly witty translation by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky is a must". (Lisa Appignanesi, Independent, Books of the Year).

    ('The Silmarillion is the central stock of J.R.R. Tolkien''s imaginative writing, a work that he could not publish in his lifetime because it grew with him. Its origins stretch back sixty years, long before The Hobbit, which was independently conceived but was caught up into what he called the "branching acquisitive theme" from which emerged The Lord of the Rings.The Silmarillion, though published last and posthumously, has the primacy, both in terms of the author''s life and in terms of its content. It is the story of the First Age in Tolkien''s world, the ancient dramas to which characters in The Lord of the Rings look back, and in whose events some of them, such as Elrond and Galadriel, took part.The three Silmarils were jewels created by Fëanor, most gifted of the Elves. Within them was imprisoned the light of the Two Trees of Valinor before the Trees themselves were destroyed by Morgoth, the first Dark Lord. Thereafter the unsullied Light of Valinor lived on only in the Silmarils; but they were seized by Morgoth and set in his crown, guarded in the impenetrable fortress of Angband in the north of Middle-earth. The Silmarillion is the history of the rebellion of Fëanor and his kindred against the gods, their exile from Valinor and return to Middle-earth, and their war, hopeleess despite their heroism, against the great Enemy.The book includes several other shorter works beside The Silmarillion proper. Preceding it are the Ainulindalë or Music of the Ainur, a myth of the Creation, and the Valaquenta, in which the nature and powers of each of the gods are set forth. After The Silmarillion is the Akallabêth, in which is recounted the downfall of the great island kingdom of Numenor at the end of the Second Age; and at the end is the tale Of the Rings of Power, in which the matter of the Lord of the Rings is treated in the manner The Silmarillion.The Silmarillion is not a romance, not a fairy tale, not a fictitious history contrived for its own sake. It is a work of unparalleled and sustained imagination, a sombre vision in the mode of myth and legend of the conflict between the desire to dominate the world and other wills and the creative power that proceeds from the development of inherent inner talents. The corruption of Fëanor, the creator of supreme beauty, by the deceits of Morgoth and by his own possessive passion for the things of his own making, and the fruits of that corruption, is one of its central themes.The Silmarillion has been edited and prepared for publication from many manuscripts by the author''s son, Christopher Tolkien.Emblems designed by J.R.R.

O romance se tornou um enorme sucesso, vindo a ser o primeiro grande livro sobre o conflito e a independência angolanos e uma referência histórica obrigatória.Numa narrativa não-linear e fragmentada, Lobo Antunes revela as inquietações existenciais de um ser humano, na indelével experiência de uma guerra, que se misturam às memórias de infância e juventude na Lisboa salazarista.O autor utiliza-se, na maior parte do romance, do fluxo de consciência e da associação de idéias, para construir a história e o perfil de seu narrador-protagonista, um personagem que, a partir de "uma dolorosa aprendizagem da agonia", vê sua vida e seus valores estilhaçados pela melancolia. O que lhe resta são fragmentos de memória - a criança que visitava com os pais o jardim zoológico aos domingos, o jovem que assiste impassível a seu futuro sendo traçado pela autoridade inquestionável de uma família salazarista, o adulto apático e frustrado diante da violência que lhe retira as rédeas e o sentido da vida.O leitor vai estar frente a frente com "decadência, putrefação, pestilência e morte. Adicionando canalhice, violência e insensatez". Para o jornalista português Nuno Barbosa, "Lobo Antunes, dando plena expressão a uma escrita impiedosa e grosseira consegue uma harmonia preciosa entre a violência do narrado e a rudez dos termos utilizados - as suas palavras ganham, portanto, uma credibilidade muito maior, criando um elo profundo com a realidade."O livro, que recebeu o prêmio Franco-Português conferido pela Embaixada da França em Lisboa, está na 21.ª edição em Portugal e já foi vendido para mais de dez países como Inglaterra, França, Itália, Alemanha e Suécia.','BIS','Paperback','9.78972E+12',217,3.97,1522,'Os Cus De Judas','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1364488875l/6215902.jpg','b1640',41.31),

George Allen and Unwin, Londres, 1937)Un gran clásico moderno y el preludio a las vastas y poderosas mitologías de El Señor de Los Anillos.Cuando alrededor de 1930, J. R. R. Tolkien comenzó a escribir El hobbit, hacía ya diez años que trabajaba en el vasto panorama mitológico de El Libro de los Relatos, que más tarde se llamaría El Silmarillion. Así como esas crónicas tempranas narraban los mitos inmemoriales de la Primera y Segunda Edad, Tolkien pronto advirtió que El hobbit iba ordenándose de algún modo como un relato de la Tercera Edad (Gandalf habla del Nigromante en las primeras páginas), aunque las inesperadas aventuras de un pacífico "hombre del campo" no parecieran tener mucha relación con las vastas y oscuras mitologías de la Tierra Media. El estilo directo y lineal, con alusiones (que el autor deploró más tarde) a un público infantil, no impide la poderosa irrupción -unas pocas veces en términos de comedia- de los grandes temas tolkienianos (el poder, la codicia, la guerra, la muerte) que reaparecerían en una dimensión a menudo obviamente épica en El Señor de los Anillos.','1st edition','Paperback','9.78968E+12',317,4.26,2423873,'El hobbit','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1298998708l/3386370.jpg','b1670',39.89),
    ('Old Mortality (1816), which many consider the finest of Scott''s Waverley novels, is a swift-moving historical romance that places an anachronistically liberal hero against the forces of fanaticism in seventeenth-century Scotland, in the period infamous as the killing time''. Its central character, Henry Morton, joins the rebels in order to fight Scotland''s royalist oppressors, little as he shares the Covenanters'' extreme religious beliefs. He is torn between his love for a royalist''s granddaughter and his loyalty to his downtrodden countrymen.As well as being a tale of divided loyalties, the novel is a crucial document in the cultural history of modern Scotland. Scott, himself a supporter of the union between Scotland and England, was trying to exorcise the violent past of a country uncomfortably coming to terms with its status as part of a modern United Kingdom. This novel is in itself a significant political document, in which Scott can be seen to be attempting to create a new centralist Scottish historiography, which is not the political consensus of his own time, the seventeenth century, or today.About the Series: For over 100 years Oxford World''s Classics has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

Scoprirà di essere l’erede del vasto patrimonio dello zio, un uomo a lui ignoto, che è vissuto in una feroce solitudine. E scoprirà anche che suo zio teneva in pugno tutti i ricchi notabili della città, riuniti in un sinistro sindacato.

The year is 1779 and the American Colonies are losing their life and death struggle for independence from Great Britain. Their rag-tag armies are in retreat.

    ('JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to enhance static web applications by providing dynamic, personalized, and interactive content. This improves the experience of visitors to your site and makes it more likely that they will visit again. You must have seen the flashy drop-down menus, moving text, and changing content that are now widespread on web sites—they are enabled through JavaScript. Supported by all the major browsers, JavaScript is the language of choice on the Web. It can even be used outside web applications—to automate administrative tasks, for example.This book aims to teach you all you need to know to start experimenting with JavaScript: what it is, how it works, and what you can do with it. Starting from the basic syntax, you''ll move on to learn how to create powerful web applications. Don''t worry if you''ve never programmed before—this book will teach you all you need to know, step by step. You''ll find that JavaScript can be a great introduction to the world of programming: with the knowledge and understanding that you''ll gain from this book, you''ll be able to move on to learn newer and more advanced technologies in the world of computing.In order to get the most out of this book, you''ll need to have an understanding of HTML and how to create a static web page. You don''t need to have any programming experience.This book will also suit you if you have some programming experience already, and would like to turn your hand to web programming. You will know a fair amount about computing concepts, but maybe not as much about web technologies.Alternatively, you may have a design background and know relatively little about the Web and computing concepts. For you, JavaScript will be a cheap and relatively easy introduction to the world of programming and web application development.Whoever you are, we hope that this book lives up to your expectations.You''ll begin by looking at exactly what JavaScript is, and taking your first steps with the underlying language and syntax. You''ll learn all the fundamental programming concepts, including data and data types, and structuring your code to make decisions in your programs or to loop over the same piece of code many times.Once you''re comfortable with the basics, you''ll move on to one of the key ideas in JavaScript—the object. You''ll learn how to take advantage of the objects that are native to the JavaScript language, such as dates and strings, and find out how these objects enable you to manage complex data and simplify your programs. Next, you''ll see how you can use JavaScript to manipulate objects made available to you in the browser, such as forms, windows, and other controls. Using this knowledge, you can start to create truly professional-looking applications that enable you to interact with the user.Long pieces of code are very hard to get right every time—even for the experienced programmer—and JavaScript code is no exception. You look at common syntax and logical errors, how you can spot them, and how to use the Microsoft Script Debugger to aid you with this task. Also, you need to examine how to handle the errors that slip through the net, and ensure that these do not detract from the experience of the end user of your application.From here, you''ll move on to more advanced topics, such as using cookies and jazzing up your web pages with dynamic HTML and XML. Finally, you''ll be looking at a relatively new and exciting technology, remote scripting. This allows your JavaScript in a HTML page to communicate directly with a server, and useful for, say, looking up information on a database sitting on your server. If you have the Google toolbar you''ll have seen something like this in action already. When you type a search word in the Google toolbar, it comes up with suggestions, which it gets via the Google search database.All the new concepts introduced in this book will be illustrated with practical examples, which enable you to experiment with JavaScript and build on the theory that you have just learned. The appendix provides solutions to the exercises included at the end of most chapters throughout the book.During the first half of the book, you''ll also be building up a more complex sample application—an online trivia quiz—which will show you how JavaScript is used in action in a real-world situation.','Second Edition','Paperback','9.78076E+12',1010,3.51,79,'Beginning JavaScript','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1178912846l/852922.jpg','b1708',8.45),

L’Impero austroungarico in cui è nata e vissuta non esiste più: con poche righe su un Trattato di pace la sua terra, il Sudtirolo, è passata all’Italia. “Il nostro cuore e la nostra mente rimarranno tedeschi in eterno”, scrive Rosa sul suo diario. Colta e libera per il suo tempo, lo tiene da quasi vent’anni, dal giorno del suo matrimonio con l’amato Jakob. Mai avrebbe pensato di riversare nelle sue pagine una così brutale lacerazione. Ne seguiranno molte altre. In pochi anni l’avvento del fascismo cambia il suo destino.

At the age of nineteen, working as a cocktail waitress in Calgary, Alberta, she began saving her tips so she could travel the globe. Aspiring to understand the world and live a significant life, she backpacked through Latin America, Laos, Bangladesh, and India, and emboldened by each adventure, went on to Sudan, Syria, and Pakistan. In war-ridden Afghanistan and Iraq she carved out a fledgling career as a television reporter. And then, in August 2008, she traveled to Somalia—“the most dangerous place on earth.” On her fourth day, she was abducted by a group of masked men along a dusty road.Held hostage for 460 days, Amanda converts to Islam as a survival tactic, receives “wife lessons” from one of her captors, and risks a daring escape. Moved between a series of abandoned houses in the desert, she survives on memory—every lush detail of the world she experienced in her life before captivity—and on strategy, fortitude, and hope.

A chronicle of a noble family in the eighteenth century; but the splendor of enchanting gardens, pleasure pavilions, and daily life of the most sophisticated refinements hides the realities of decay and self-destruction.About the Author:Cao Xueqin (1715? - 1763?) is the author of A Dream of Red Mansions. His personal name was Zhan, and his style (name adopted by a man at his coming of age), Mengruan. He was also know as Xueqin, Qinpu or Qinxi.His ancestral home was in what is now Liaoyang City, in Northeast China, and his forebears, although Han Chinese themselves, had been accepted into the ManchuRight White Banner. For three successive generations, a period of some 60 years, his ancestors had held the post of Textile Commissioner in Jiangning (present-day Nanjing). His paternal great grandmother, surnamed Sun, had been nursemaid to the infant who was later to become the Kangxi emperor''s study companion and close attendant, accompanying him when he came to the throne on four of his six inspection tours of the south, a singular honor.

A man no longer scared of what tomorrow might bring, all he wanted was to be with Laura, the wife he deeply loved, and start a new life.But just days before his release, Laura and Shadow’s best friend are killed in an accident. With his life in pieces and nothing to keep him tethered, Shadow accepts a job from a beguiling stranger he meets on the way home, an enigmatic man who calls himself Mr. Wednesday.

But as Hinton realized and accepted his fate, he resolved not only to survive, but find a way to live on Death Row. For the next twenty-seven years he was a beacon—transforming not only his own spirit, but those of his fellow inmates, fifty-four of whom were executed mere feet from his cell.

    ('David Foster Wallace’s first novel, The Broom of the System, earned comparisons with the work of John Irving, Thomas Pynchon, and Tom Robbins. But no comparison could prepare us for what is surely one of the most original and adventurous novels of the decade: Infinite Jest.Infinite Jest is the name of a movie said to be so entertaining that anyone who watches it loses all desire to do anything but watch it. People die happily, viewing it in endless repetition. The novel Infinite Jest is the story of this addictive entertainment, and in particular how it affects a Boston halfway house for recovering addicts and a nearby tennis academy, whose students have many budding addictions of their own. As the novel unfolds, various individuals, organizations, and governments vie to obtain the master copy of Infinite Jest for their own ends, and the denizens of the tennis school and the halfway house are caught up in increasingly desperate efforts to control the movie – as is a cast including burglars, transvestite muggers, scam artists, medical professionals, pro football stars, bookies, drug addicts both active and recovering, film students, political assassins, and one of the most endearingly messed-up families ever captured in a novel.On this outrageous frame hangs an exploration of essential questions about what entertainment is, and why it has come to so dominate our lives; about how our desire for entertainment interacts with our need to connect with other humans; and about what the pleasures we choose say about who we are. Equal parts philosophical quest and screwball comedy, Infinite Jest bends every rule of fiction without sacrificing for a moment its own entertainment value. The huge cast and multilevel narrative serve a story that accelerates to a breathtaking, heartbreaking, unforgettable conclusion. It is an exuberant, uniquely American exploration of the passions that make us human - and one of those rare books that renew the very idea of what a novel can do.(from dust-jacket of the First Edition, 1996)','First Edition','Hardcover','9.78032E+12',1079,4.3,63617,'Infinite Jest','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1415152661l/544063.jpg','b1838',9.23),

A fresh start that is rudely interrupted by a coven casting a curse over Spook—the town most monsters, and now Daphne, call home. Wanting to be more gutsy in the afterlife, she takes it upon herself to end the curse. Well, she takes it upon herself to tag along with a ghostly cowboy, Chance L.

Trigger point therapy is one of the most intriguing and fastest-growing bodywork styles in the world. Medical doctors, chiropractors, and alternative health practitioners are all beginning to use this technique to relieve the pain of individuals suffering from undiagnosable soft tissue pain-a condition that studies have shown to be the cause of nearly 25 percent of all doctor visits. The technique involves applying a gentle, sweeping stroke to trigger points, places in muscle or connective tissue where a lack of oxygen causes swelling. These points are easily located by general readers and create pain throughout the body in predictable patterns characteristic to each muscle, producing discomfort ranging from mild to severe. The stimulation of the point causes an increase in the oxygen level in the area and often produces instant relief.The first edition of The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook has made a huge impact in the use of this dynamic technique.

As he goes about the task, each step in his search is made more difficult through the interference of politicians, the media and his own government.Robert’s examination constantly draws him back to Alexander who regales him with a tale of swordsmanship from his lineage featuring events of mankind’s bloody past and often oddly having a connection to the case before him.With the clock ticking as New York collapses into a deep panic, he must catch the Sword Masters before it is too late!','1st','Paperback','9.78099E+12',304,4.0,13,'Lest the Dew Rust Them','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1361659681l/17410811.jpg','b1881',14.41),

On Human Nature begins a new phase in the most important intellectual controversy of this generation: Is human behavior controlled by the species'' biological heritage? Does this heritage limit human destiny?With characteristic pugency and simplicity of style, the author of Sociobiology challenges old prejudices and current misconceptions about the nature-nurture debate. In his new preface E. O.

    ('Verschenen in 2004 - Geert Mak reisde met de twintigste eeuw mee, in een krakeling van routes, langs Londen, Volgograd en Madrid, langs de bunkers van Berlijn, de geparfu meerde kleerkasten van Helena Ceausescu in Boekarest en de speelgoe dautos in een verlaten crèche in Tsjernobyl.Wat heeft een straatarme, tandeloze bejaarde in een afgelegen, vervallen dorpje in Roemenië gemeen met de bewoner van een Hollandse nieuwbouwwijk, hybride auto voor de deur, golfset in de gang? Niet veel – maar ze wonen wel allebei in een land dat deel uitmaakt van Europa. Binnen de grenzen van dat continent lijken de verschillende tijdlagen soms als kruiend ijs over elkaar te schuiven: de ene plaats geeft je het gevoel dat de tijd heeft stilgestaan, op andere plekken vallen de vernieuwingen niet bij te benen.In 1999, vlak voordat er weer een hoofdstuk van een eeuw Europa ten einde zou gaan, maakte Geert Mak in opdracht van NRCHandelsblad een reis door die oude wereld. Zijn doel: ‘een soort eindinspectie: hoe lag het continent erbij, aan het slot van de twintigste eeuw?’ Tegelijk was het een ‘historische reis’: ‘ik volgde, voor zover mogelijk, de loop van de geschiedenis, op zoek naar sporen die waren achtergebleven.’ De inhoudsopgave van het boek bestaat uit een indrukwekkende lijst plaatsen waar geschiedenis is geschreven: Verdun, Ieper, Berlijn, Predappio, Leningrad, Vichy, Neurenberg, Lourdes, Tsjernobyl en Novi Sad, om er een paar te noemen. Overal bezocht Mak plaatsen van herinnering, hij dook in archieven en sprak met schrijvers, historici, filosofen, politici, verzetslieden en militairen, maar ook met hele gewone mensen die over hun leven vertelden. Al die gesprekken, al die documenten, al die boeken, ze hebben geleid tot een imposant verhaal over een eeuw Europa, een werelddeel dat wel één naam draagt maar nooit echt een eenheid was. En hoe kan het anders, gezien de totaal verschillende culturen binnen de grenzen ervan en het gegeven dat het gelijktijdige zo ongelijk kan zijn – niet lang geleden nog heel schrijnend, toen er in Joegoslavië, op twee uurtjes vliegen afstand van het kalme, nijvere Nederland, een burgeroorlog uitbrak.De twintigste eeuw is verleden tijd, geschiedenis. Er woedden oorlogen, de Muur viel, er kwam een Europese munt. In de machtige studie die In Europa is, maken we het allemaal nog een keer mee, vaak via verhalen uit de eerste hand, via ooggetuigenverslagen. Dat het daarbij lijkt dat de chaos toeneemt naarmate we het heden naderen, maakt deel uit van de paradox van de geschiedenis: hoe verder een tijdvak uit het zicht verdwijnt, hoe scherper het beeld zich toont. Maks boek is een fascinerend mozaïek van verhalen en geschiedenissen, waar we later, op grotere afstand, misschien heel nieuwe patronen in zullen ontwaren.`Begin 1999 verliet ik Amsterdam voor een reis door Europa die een vol jaar zou duren. Het was een soort laatste inspectie: hoe lag het continent erbij, aan het eind van de twintigste eeuw? Maar het was ook een historische reis: ik volgde letterlijk de sporen van de geschiedenis, door de eeuw en door het continent, beginnend in januari, bij de resten van de Parijse Wereldtentoonstelling en het bruisende Wenen, eindigend in december, in de ruïnes van Sarajevo.Dat hele jaar reisde ik zo met de eeuw mee, in een krakeling van routes, langs Londen, Volgograd en Madrid, langs de bunkers van Berlijn, de geparfu meerde kleerkasten van Helena Ceausescu in Boekarest en de speelgoe dautos in een verlaten crèche in Tsjernobyl. En ik praatte met de getuigen: met schrijvers en politici, met verzetsmensen en hoge offi cie ren, met een boer in de Pyreneeën en met de kleinzoon van de Duitse keizer, tientallen Europeanen die hun verhaal op tafel legden.Dit reisverslag gaat over het verleden, en wat het verleden met ons doet.

As the most beautiful girl in Gavaldon, Sophie has dreamed of being kidnapped into an enchanted world her whole life. With her pink dresses, glass slippers, and devotion to good deeds, she knows she’ll earn top marks at the School for Good and graduate a storybook princess. Meanwhile Agatha, with her shapeless black frocks, wicked pet cat, and dislike of nearly everyone, seems a natural fit for the School for Evil.But when the two girls are swept into the Endless Woods, they find their fortunes reversed—Sophie’s dumped in the School for Evil to take Uglification, Death Curses, and Henchmen Training, while Agatha finds herself in the School For Good, thrust amongst handsome princes and fair maidens for classes in Princess Etiquette and Animal Communication..

First published in 1853, Villette is Brontë''s most accomplished and deeply felt work, eclipsing even Jane Eyre in critical acclaim.Her narrator, the autobiographical Lucy Snowe, flees England and a tragic past to become an instructor in a French boarding school in the town of Villette. There she unexpectedly confronts her feelings of love and longing as she witnesses the fitful romance between Dr. John, a handsome young Englishman, and Ginerva Fanshawe, a beautiful coquette. This first pain brings others, and with them comes the heartache Lucy has tried so long to escape. Yet in spite of adversity and disappointment, Lucy Snowe survives to recount the unstinting vision of a turbulent life''s journey — a journey that is one of the most insightful fictional studies of a woman''s consciousness in English literature."For the woman writing Villette - both the narrator, Lucy Snowe, and the actual author, Charlotte Brontë - imagination is finally victorious over human justice, and Villette, record of pain and defeat that it is, is also Lucy Snowe''s own festival of bas coeur, the buried heart."From the Introduction by Susan Fromberg Schaeffer','Bantam Classic reissue','Paperback','9.78055E+12',529,3.75,53052,'Villette','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320537649l/1033198.jpg','b1904',45.15),

    ('Updated with maps, photographs, and battlefield diagrams, this special fiftieth anniversary edition of the classic history of the Korean War is a dramatic and hard-hitting account of the conflict written from the perspective of those who fought it. Partly drawn from official records, operations journals, and histories, it is based largely on the compelling personal narratives of the small-unit commanders and their troops. Unlike any other work on the Korean War, it provides both a clear panoramic overview and a sharply drawn "you were there" account of American troops in fierce combat against the North Korean and Chinese communist invaders. As Americans and North Koreans continue to face each other across the 38th Parallel, This Kind of War commemorates the past and offers vital lessons for the future.','50th Anniversary Edition','Paperback','9.78157E+12',540,4.26,1719,'This Kind of War: A Study in Unpreparedness','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388210340l/118690.jpg','b1906',17.07),
    ('Published more than 30 years ago, Veena Gavankar’s biography of African-American scientist and agriculturist George Washington Carver, has remained one of the bestsellers in Marathi literature even today.A gripping story about a man and his determination to succeed amidst hardship and hurdles, the book not only captures the essence of perseverance, but also beautifully portrays how the desire and a thirst for knowledge indeed, does lead to greatness.Dubbed by the Times magazine in 1941 as the “Black Leonardo”, Carver’s contributions to the fields of botany and agriculture are immense. His courage and conviction, to get an education in spite of growing up in a society ridden with prejudice and reeking with the aftermath of the apartheid, is astutely covered by the author.Short, simple and neatly written, Gavankar has touched every aspect of the life and struggles of Carver, his achievements and his many talents. Known as the Peanut Man in America and all around the world today, Carver is said to be the man behind the development of the quintessential American spread, the peanut butter. His message - about persevering in the face of adversity and making something out of whatever one has in life - is simply but clearly depicted, and this biography has served as an inspiration to hundreds of Indians all over the country.Ek Hota Carver, which began as a result of a mother’s search for bedtime stories for her children, has been on the best-selling Marathi literature for over 30 years, from the time it was first published. Soon to be available as an audiobook, Ek Hota Carver has also had the distinction of being run into 34 editions.','Deluxe edition','Paperback','9.78817E+12',184,4.21,2130,'एक होता कार्व्हर','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1378314986l/11253505.jpg','b1907',18.74),

A series of vivid memories from adolescence, college, and the struggling years that led up to his first novel, Carrie, will afford readers a fresh and often very funny perspective on the formation of a writer. King next turns to the basic tools of his trade -- how to sharpen and multiply them through use, and how the writer must always have them close at hand. He takes the reader through crucial aspects of the writer''s art and life, offering practical and inspiring advice on everything from plot and character development to work habits and rejection.Serialized in the New Yorker to vivid acclaim, On Writing culminates with a profoundly moving account of how King''s overwhelming need to write spurred him toward recovery, and brought him back to his life.Brilliantly structured, friendly and inspiring, On Writing will empower -- and entertain -- everyone who reads it.--front flap','US / CAN','Hardcover','9.78068E+12',288,4.32,177519,'On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1304619831l/437148.jpg','b1931',43.89),

In the east, Daenerys Targaryen, the last scion of House Targaryen, rules with her three dragons as queen of a city built on dust and death. But Daenerys has thousands of enemies, and many have set out to find her. As they gather, one young man embarks upon his own quest for the queen, with an entirely different goal in mind.Fleeing from Westeros with a price on his head, Tyrion Lannister, too, is making his way to Daenerys. But his newest allies in this quest are not the rag-tag band they seem, and at their heart lies one who could undo Daenerys’s claim to Westeros forever.Meanwhile, to the north lies the mammoth Wall of ice and stone—a structure only as strong as those guarding it.

    ('“This is your country, this is your world, this is your body, and you must find some way to live within the all of it.” In a profound work that pivots from the biggest questions about American history and ideals to the most intimate concerns of a father for his son, Ta-Nehisi Coates offers a powerful new framework for understanding our nation’s history and current crisis. Americans have built an empire on the idea of “race,” a falsehood that damages us all but falls most heavily on the bodies of black women and men—bodies exploited through slavery and segregation, and, today, threatened, locked up, and murdered out of all proportion. What is it like to inhabit a black body and find a way to live within it? And how can we all honestly reckon with this fraught history and free ourselves from its burden?  Between the World and Me is Ta-Nehisi Coates’s attempt to answer these questions in a letter to his adolescent son. Coates shares with his son—and readers—the story of his awakening to the truth about his place in the world through a series of revelatory experiences, from Howard University to Civil War battlefields, from the South Side of Chicago to Paris, from his childhood home to the living rooms of mothers whose children’s lives were taken as American plunder. Beautifully woven from personal narrative, reimagined history, and fresh, emotionally charged reportage, Between the World and Me clearly illuminates the past, bracingly confronts our present, and offers a transcendent vision for a way forward.','eAudiobook','Audiobook','9.78015E+12',4,4.4,139114,'Between the World and Me','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1433799467l/25147754.jpg','b1938',40.5),

Stay cool.No one knows exactly when it began or where it originated. A terrifying new plague is spreading like wildfire across the country, striking cities one by one: Boston, Detroit, Seattle. The doctors call it Draco Incendia Trychophyton. To everyone else it’s Dragonscale, a highly contagious, deadly spore that marks its hosts with beautiful black and gold marks across their bodies—before causing them to burst into flames.

No one is safe.Harper Grayson, a compassionate, dedicated nurse as pragmatic as Mary Poppins, treated hundreds of infected patients before her hospital burned to the ground. Now she’s discovered the telltale gold-flecked marks on her skin. When the outbreak first began, she and her husband, Jakob, had made a pact: they would take matters into their own hands if they became infected.

At the hospital, she witnessed infected mothers give birth to healthy babies and believes hers will be fine too. . . if she can live long enough to deliver the child.Convinced that his do-gooding wife has made him sick, Jakob becomes unhinged, and eventually abandons her as their placid New England community collapses in terror.

Quando a pedra se rompe e dela nasce Saphira, Eragon é forçado a se converter em herói.Involuntariamente, o jovem é lançado para um arriscado mundo novo movido pelas tramas do destino, da magia e do poder.

    ('Here, for the first time, is a volume that gathers the published verse of Allen Ginsberg in its entirety, a half century of brilliant work from one of America''s great poets. The chief figure among the Beats, Ginsberg changed the course of American poetry, liberating it from closed academic forms with the creation of open, vocal, spontaneous, and energetic postmodern verse in the tradition of Walt Whitman, Guillaume Apollinaire, Hart Crane, Ezra Pound, and William Carlos Williams. Ginsberg''s classics Howl, Reality Sandwiches, Kaddish, Planet News, and The Fall of America led American (and international) poetry toward uncensored vernacular, explicit candor, the ecstatic, the rhapsodic, and the sincere—all leavened by an attractive and pervasive streak of common sense. Ginsberg''s raw tones and attitudes of spiritual liberation also helped catalyze a psychological revolution that has become a permanent part of our cultural heritage, profoundly influencing not only poetry and popular song and speech, but also our view of the world.The uninterrupted energy of Ginsberg''s remarkable career is clearly revealed in this collection. Seen in order of composition, the poems reflect on one another; they are not only works but also a work. Included here are all the poems from the earlier volume Collected Poems 1947-1980, and from Ginsberg''s subsequent and final three books of new poetry: White Shroud, Cosmopolitan Greetings, and Death & Fame. Enriching this book are illustrations by Ginsberg''s artist friends; unusual and illuminating notes to the poems, inimitably prepared by the poet himself; extensive indexes; as well as prefaces and various other materials that accompanied the original publications.','First Edition','Hardcover','9.78006E+12',1216,4.34,2405,'Collected Poems 1947-1997','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1389836837l/50316.jpg','b1958',49.38),

    ('Used as a reference by students of acupuncture, this is a hefty, truly comprehensive guide to the theory and healing power of Chinese medicine. It''s also a primer on nutrition--including facts about green foods, such as spirulina and blue-green algae, and the "regeneration diets" used by cancer patients and arthritics--along with an inspiring cookbook with more than 300 mostly vegetarian, nutrient-packed recipes.The information on Chinese medicine is useful for helping to diagnose health imbalances, especially nascent illnesses. It''s smartly paired with the whole-foods program because the Chinese have attributed various health-balancing properties to foods, so you can tailor your diet to help alleviate symptoms of illness. For example, Chinese medicine dictates that someone with low energy and a pale complexion (a yin deficiency) would benefit from avoiding bitter foods and increasing "sweet" foods such as soy, black sesame seeds, parsnips, rice, and oats. (Note that the Chinese definition of sweet foods is much different from the American one!)Pitchford says in his dedication that he hopes the reader finds "healing, awareness, and peace" from following his program. The diet is certainly acetic by American standards (no alcohol, caffeine, white flour, fried foods, or sugar, and a minimum of eggs and dairy) but the reasons he gives for avoiding these "negative energy" foods are compelling. From the adrenal damage imparted by coffee to immune dysfunction brought on by excess refined sugar, Pitchford spurs you to rethink every dietary choice and its ultimate influence on your health. Without being alarmist, he adds dietary tips for protecting yourself against the dangers of modern life, including neutralizing damage from water fluoridation (thyroid and immune-system problems may result; fluoride is a carcinogen).

Aged 13, when he learned his kind and thoughtful English teacher voted Conservative, he nearly fell off his chair: ''To be good, you had to be on the Left.'' Today he''s no less confused. When he looks around him, in the aftermath of the invasion of Iraq, he sees a community of Left-leaning liberals standing on their heads.

Ifemelu--beautiful, self-assured--left Nigeria 15 years ago, and now studies in Princeton as a Graduate Fellow. She seems to have fulfilled every immigrant''s dream: Ivy League education; success as a writer of a wildly popular political blog; money for the things she needs. But what came before is more like a nightmare: wrenching departure from family; humiliating jobs under a false name. She feels for the first time the weight of something she didn''t think about back home: race.Obinze--handsome and kind-hearted--was Ifemelu''s teenage love; he''d hoped to join her in America, but post 9/11 America wouldn''t let him in. Obinze''s journey leads him to back alleys of illegal employment in London; to a fake marriage for the sake of a work card, and finally, to a set of handcuffs as he is exposed and deported. Years later, when they reunite in Nigeria, neither is the same person who left home. Obinze is the kind of successful "Big Man" he''d scorned in his youth, and Ifemelu has become an "Americanah"--a different version of her former self, one with a new accent and attitude. As they revisit their shared passion--for their homeland and for each other--they must face the largest challenges of their lives.

Perché anche le famiglie possono soffrire di solitudine, proprio come le persone. Ad accudire in silenzio tutte le incertezze, oltre a prendersi cura del loro bambino, ci ha sempre pensato la signora A. Per questo, quando arriva un male a portarsela via, si spalanca in casa un vuoto improvviso. Nora e suo marito devono ancora accorgersi che il coraggio della signora A., ormai, appartiene anche a loro.È dentro le stanze che le famiglie crescono: strepitanti, incerte, allegre, spaventate. Giovani coppie alle prime armi, pronte ad abbracciarsi o a perdersi. Come Nora e suo marito. Ma di quelle stanze bisogna prima o poi spalancare porte e finestre, aprirsi al tempo che passa, all''aria di fuori. «A lungo andare ogni amore ha bisogno di qualcuno che lo veda e riconosca, che lo avvalori, altrimenti rischia di essere scambiato per un malinteso». È così che la signora A., nell''attimo stesso in cui entra in casa per occuparsi delle faccende domestiche, diventa la custode di una relazione, la bussola per orientarsi nella bonaccia e nella burrasca.

    ('The international literary sensation-a runaway bestseller in Spain, rights sold in more than 20 countries-about a boy''s quest through the secrets and shadows of postwar Barcelona for a mysterious author whose book has proved as dangerous to own as it is impossible to forget.  Barcelona, 1945-just after the war, a great world city lies in shadow, nursing its wounds, and a boy named Daniel awakes on his eleventh birthday to find that he can no longer remember his mother''s face. To console his only child, Daniel''s widowed father, an antiquarian book dealer, initiates him into the secret of the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, a library tended by Barcelona''s guild of rare-book dealers as a repository for books forgotten by the world, waiting for someone who will care about them again. Daniel''s father coaxes him to choose a volume from the spiraling labyrinth of shelves, one that, it is said, will have a special meaning for him. And Daniel so loves the novel he selects, The Shadow of the Wind by one Julian Carax, that he sets out to find the rest of Carax''s work. To his shock, he discovers that someone has been systematically destroying every copy of every book this author has written. In fact, he may have the last one in existence. Before Daniel knows it his seemingly innocent quest has opened a door into one of Barcelona''s darkest secrets, an epic story of murder, magic, madness and doomed love.

    ('Sylvain Tesson, pour rassasier son besoin de liberté, a trouvé une solution radicale et vieille comme les expériences des ermites de la vieille Russie : s’enfermer seul dans une cabane en pleine taïga sibérienne, sur les bords du Baïkal, pendant six mois. De février à juillet 2010, il a choisi de faire l’expérience du silence, de la solitude, et du froid. Sa cabane, construite par des géologues soviétiques dans les années brejnéviennes, est un cube de rondins de trois mètres sur trois, chauffé par un poêle en fonte, à six jours de marche du premier village et à des centaines de kilomètres d’une piste. Vivre isolé du monde nécessite avant tout de s’imposer un rythme. Le matin, Sylvain Tesson lit, écrit, fume, ou dessine. Puis ce sont cinq longues heures consacrées à la vie domestique : il faut couper le bois, déblayer la neige, préparer les lignes de pêche, réparer les avanies de l’hiver… Le défi de six mois d’ermitage, c’est de savoir si l’on réussira à se supporter. En cas de dégoût de soi, nulle épaule où s’appuyer, nul visage pour se lustrer les yeux. L’inspecteur forestierChabourov qui l’a déposé sur cette grève le premier jour le savait. Il lui a glissé, énigmatique, en se touchant la tempe : « Ici, c’est un magnifique endroit pour se suicider ». La solitude finira par se révéler fertile : quand on n’a personne à qui exposer ses pensées, la feuille de papier est un confident précieux ; le carnet de note, un compagnon poli. C’est ce journal que nous offre à lire Sylvain Tesson. En notant minutieusement, presque quotidiennement, ses impressions face au silence, ses luttes pour survivre dans une nature hostile, ses désespoirs, ses doutes, mais aussi, ses moments d’extase, de paix intérieure et d’osmose avec la nature, Sylvain Tesson nous fait partager une expérience hors du commun. Finalement « la vie en cabane apprend à peupler l’instant, à ne rien attendre de l’avenir et à accepter ce qui advient comme une fête. Le génie du lieu aide à apprivoiser le temps ».

    ('Quello che si incontra comunemente, negli studi odierni sulla filosofia greca, è il tentativo di restituire contenuti remotissimi da noi con gli strumenti più moderni, condizionati dalle formule e dai metodi odierni della ricerca storica, in breve con il linguaggio filologico. Qui invece Giorgio Colli prova a far riemergere il periodo culminante della Grecia – il settimo, il sesto, il quinto secolo a.C. –, il più lontano da noi e dalla nostra comprensione, senza suggerire approcci specialistici. L’accessibilità del suo modo di esporre è raggiunta mediante un’inversione di prospettiva: non sono gli occhi del presente a guardare quei secoli, rimpiccioliti dalla grande distanza, e neppure gli occhi del quarto secolo a.C., di Aristotele, ma al contrario si tenta di evocare uno sguardo «alle spalle» di quei secoli, uno sguardo gettato dagli dèi omerici e pre-omerici. In questo spingersi all’indietro, verso un’antichità dal profilo incerto, l’origine della filosofia greca, questo evento misterioso, non è ricacciata in un passato più lontano, ma viene riportata al contrario a un’epoca assai posteriore, è un prodotto mediato che si lega al nome di Platone. Prima c’è l’età dei sapienti. Quando nasce la filosofia, la parabola dell’eccellenza greca ha già iniziato il suo declino. E questa crisi decisiva è anteriore anche a Euripide e a Socrate, è una frattura, un indebolimento che sono interni al mondo dei sapienti, che solo attraverso questo si decifrano.','Piccola Biblioteca #29','Paperback','9.78885E+12',116,4.05,195,'La nascita della filosofia','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1381182533l/9696639.jpg','b2039',36.81),

Le directeur, par pruderie, l''avait sérieusement raboté, ce qui ne l''a pas empêché de provoquer un premier soulèvement d''indignation. Par la suite, Wilde a augmenté et remanié son roman, estompant ses passages les plus audacieux. La critique instruisait déjà son procès en immoralité.

    ('Tradition has painted a portrait of a Savior who stands aloof from governmental concerns and who calls his disciples to an apolitical life. But such a picture of Jesus is far from accurate, according to John Howard Yoder. This watershed work in New Testament ethics leads us to a Savior who was deeply concerned with the agenda of politics and the related issues of power, status, and right relations. By canvassing Luke''s Gospel, Yoder argues convincingly that the true impact of Jesus'' life and ministry on his disciples'' social behavior points to a specific kind of Christian pacifism in which "the cross of Christ is the model of Christian social efficacy." This second edition of The Politics of Jesus provides up-to-date interaction with recent publications that touch on Yoder''s timely topic. Following most of the chapters are new "epilogues" summarizing research conducted during the last two decades - research that continues to support the outstanding insights set forth in Yoder''s original work.','2nd Edition','Paperback','9.7808E+12',257,4.07,3134,'The Politics of Jesus','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1386923367l/19133.jpg','b2087',11.15),

Getting Even, a collection of his late ''60s magazine pieces, offers a look into Allen''s bag of shtick, back when it was new. From the supposed memoirs of Hitler''s barber: "Then, in January of ''45, a plot by several generals to shave Hitler''s moustache in his sleep failed when von Stauffenberg, in the darkness of Hitler''s bedroom, shaved off one of the Führer''s eyebrows instead..." Even tho the idea of writing jokes about old Adolf--or addled rabbis, or Maatjes herring--isn''t nearly as fresh as it used to be, Getting Even still delivers plenty of laughs. At his best, Woody can achieve a level of transcendent craziness that no other writer can match.

Focusing on the use of language as both a vehicle and a tool to shape persuasive argument, Aristotle delineates with remarkable insight both practical and aesthetic elements and their proper combination in an effective presentation, oral or written. He also emphasizes the role of language in achieving precision and clarity of thought.The ancients regarded rhetoric as the crowning intellectual discipline — the synthesis of logical principles and other knowledge attained from years of schooling. Modern readers will find considerable relevance in Aristotelian rhetoric and its focus on developing persuasive tools of argumentation.

But perhaps they are no longer alone in this opinion. Newly allied with the powerful African empire of the Tswana, the French have occupied Spain and brought revolution and bloodshed to Brazil, threatening Britain’s last desperate hope to defeat Napoleon.   And now the government that sidelined them has decided they have the best chance at negotiating a peace with the angry Tswana, who have besieged the Portuguese royal family in Rio—and thus offer to reinstate Laurence to his former rank and seniority as a captain in the Aerial Corps. Temeraire is delighted by this sudden reversal of fortune, but Laurence is by no means sanguine, knowing from experience that personal honor and duty to one’s country do not always run on parallel tracks.   Nonetheless, the pair embark for Brazil, only to meet with a string of unmitigated disasters that force them to make an unexpected landing in the hostile territory of the Incan empire, where they face new unanticipated dangers.   Now with the success of the mission balanced on a razor’s edge, and failure looking more likely by the minute, the unexpected arrival of an old enemy will tip the scales toward ruin.

In a series of episodes covering the course of a single day, 16 June 1904, the novel traces the movements of Leopold Bloom and Stephen Dedalus through the streets of Dublin. Each episode has its own literary style, and the epic journey of Odysseus is only one of many correspondencies that add layers of meaning to the text.

C''è chi dice che sia il dio più antico, altri invece sostiene che è il dio più giovane, altri che è un grande demone. A tutti esso appare "meraviglioso fra gli uomini e gli dei". Le due forme di Afrodite, il mito dell''androgino, le origini dell''antichissimo desiderio di "fare, di due, uno" e così di "guarire la natura umana", la "morbidezza" e l'' "asprezza" dell''amore, la natura del desiderio: con articolazione sottilissima, attraverso le varie voci, Platone tocca tutti i punti sensibili dell''eros e infine affida a una vera iniziatrice ai "misteri d''amore", Diotima, il compito di schiuderne i segreti ultimi. E qui, come pure nell''ultima, trascinante apparizione di Alcibiade, diventano espliciti, forse più di altre volte in Platone, i riferimenti alla "sapienza" e all'' "enigma".

She is also an acclaimed author of powerful and perceptive nonfiction, fantasy, and literary fiction. She has received many honors, including six Nebula and five Hugo Awards, the National Book Award, the Pushcart Prize, the Newbery, the Pilgrim, the Tiptree, and citations by the American Library Association. She has written over a dozen highly regarded novels and story collections. Her SF masterworks are The Left Hand of Darkness (1969), The Dispossessed (1974), and The Lathe of Heaven (1971). George Orr has dreams that come true--dreams that change reality. He dreams that the aunt who is sexually harassing him is killed in a car crash, and wakes to find that she died in a wreck six weeks ago, in another part of the country. But a far darker dream drives George into the care of a psychotherapist--a dream researcher who doesn''t share George''s ambivalence about altering reality.

In celebration of the series that has captured the heart of millions, here is a special 20th anniversary edition of the novel that started it all—including a new essay, a new map, a CD with Outlander the musical, and more. OUTLANDERThe year is 1945. Claire Randall, a former combat nurse, is just back from the war and reunited with her husband on a second honeymoon when she walks through a standing stone in one of the ancient circles that dot the British Isles. Suddenly she is a Sassenach—an “outlander”—in a Scotland torn by war and raiding border clans in the year of Our Lord . . . 1743.   Hurled back in time by forces she cannot understand, Claire is catapulted into the intrigues of lairds and spies that may threaten her life, and shatter her heart. For here James Fraser, a gallant young Scots warrior, shows her a love so absolute that Claire becomes a woman torn between fidelity and desire—and between two vastly different men in two irreconcilable lives.  Praise for Diana Gabaldon’s Outlander novels   “Marvelous and fantastic adventures, romance, sex . . . perfect escape reading.”—San Francisco Chronicle, on Outlander  “History comes deliciously alive on the page.”—New York Daily News, on Outlander   “Gabaldon is a born storyteller. . . .

No philosopher is more important for his careful, critical, and deeply perceptive examination of the grounds for belief in divine powers and for his sceptical accounts of the causes and consequences of religious belief, expressed most powerfully in the Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion and The Natural History of Religion. The Dialogues ask if belief in God can be inferred from the nature of the universe or whether it is even consistent with what we know about the universe. The Natural History of Religion investigates the origins of belief, and follows its development from harmless polytheism to dogmatic monotheism.

One boy thrives, nurtured by the love of all those around him; the other grows up in loneliness, enveloped by a mysterious darkness.First published in 1952, East of Eden is the work in which Steinbeck created his most mesmerizing characters and explored his most enduring themes: the mystery of identity, the inexplicability of love, and the murderous consequences of love''s absence.

Their somber poetry and rich moods of menace and melancholy have conjured some of the most haunting images in American literature: the accusing echo of the tell-tale heart, the beloved but doomed Annabel Lee, the gloom-shrouded House of Usher, the maddening tortures of the pit and pendulum, the eerie and enigmatic Raven.Dramatic and irreversible, Poe''s work invites us to match our darkest imaginings to his vision of the world colored by grief and madness and haunted by specters of guilt and death.

    ('"Controversial in both life and art, Francis Bacon was one of the most important painters of the twentieth century. His monumental, unsettling images have an extraordinary power to disturb, shock, and haunt the spectator, "to unlock the valves of feeling and therefore return the onlooker to life more violently".Eminent writer and curator David Sylvester provides the definitive account of the career of an artist whose friend and collaborator he was for more than forty years. Drawing on his unparalleled personal knowledge of Bacon''s inspirations and intentions, he first offers a critical overview of the development of Bacon''s work from 1933 to the early 1990s, and then addresses its crucial aspects.

As their lives become more intertwined, all are forced to confront the uncomfortable truths of the past and seek out the courage to forgive.In 1945, Elsie Schmidt is a naive teenager, as eager for her first sip of champagne as she is for her first kiss.

Roland Deschain and his ka-tet—Jake, Susannah, Eddie, and Oy, the billy-bumbler—encounter a ferocious storm just after crossing the River Whye on their way to the Outer Baronies. As they shelter from the howling gale, Roland tells his friends not just one strange story but two . . . and in so doing, casts new light on his own troubled past.

What differentiates them, and gives this extraordinary book its complexity and brilliance, is the way each expresses her suffering: Marianne–young, impetuous, ardent–falls into paroxysms of grief when she is rejected by the dashing John Willoughby; while her sister, Elinor—wiser, more sensible, more self-controlled—masks her despair when it appears that Edward Ferrars is to marry the mean-spirited and cunning Lucy Steele. All, of course, ends happily—but not until Elinor’s “sense” and Marianne’s “sensibility” have equally worked to reveal the profound emotional life that runs beneath the surface of Austen’s immaculate and irresistible art.(Book Jacket Status: Jacketed)','Everyman''s Library Classics, #51','Hardcover','9.78068E+12',367,4.06,839308,'Sense and Sensibility','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1428946529l/467994.jpg','b2283',9.53),

If the Seventine are released, will anyone survive?Abigail Swish might not love her life, living in gang-ridden New York in 2035 and training to fight and survive with Compound 23. But she is grateful for a few things, especially her no-filter-between-brain-and-mouth best friend Lucy and her escape each night into a dream world far different from her own. In fact, sometimes she lives for the fleeting moments she spends at night with the man who fuels every romantic fantasy she’s ever had. But each morning reality returns. She could just cry. But she won’t of course; tears don’t change a damn thing.Then without any warning, a month before her eighteenth birthday, everything does change. A guardian finds her. He explains, in a strangely familiar accent, that she was stashed on Earth for safekeeping and has been lost to her family ever since. And it is time to return home. To the First World; a land of unimagined beauty. Abigail and Lucy find themselves escaping New York, ending up on another planet and traversing through an unforgiving wilderness. Yeah, because that sort of thing just happens every day. Luckily an unexpected saviour arrives; the man from her dream-world. Brace is six-and-a-half feet of gorgeous perfectness, wrapped in an arrogance like no other. Unable to trust his assistance, and unsure which of her instincts to follow - kiss him or punch him in the mouth - Abigail eventually accepts his help to find her family. And what a family. Enter Josian, her father; larger than life and apparently not even human. He is Walker, a planet-less race revered as gods, causing mischief and mayhem through-out this star-system.

Butterfly opens in the cramped prison cell where diplomat Rene Gallimard is being held captive by the French government - and by his own illusions. In the darkness of his cell he recalls a time when desire seemed to give him wings. A time when Song Liling, the beautiful Chinese diva, touched him with a love as vivid, as seductive - and as elusive - as a butterfly.How could he have known, then, that his ideal woman was, in fact, a spy for the Chinese government - and a man disguised as a woman? In a series of flashbacks, the diplomat relives the twenty-year affair from the temptation to the seduction, from its consummation to the scandal that ultimately consumed them both. But in the end, there remains only one truth: Whether or not Gallimard''s passion was a flight of fancy, it sparked the most vigorous emotions of his life.Only in real life could love become so unreal.

What life would be like if your enemies or rivals didn’t exist at all? Brian Sunderland, whom some might call a “profound researcher,” has been looking for answers to these questions. In fact, his entire life so far has been ruled by this quest, as he journeys through various dilemmas, such as surrendering to true love, his coming of age, fighting, standing up for his rights, helping others, and finally, leaving his mark on this world. In stark contrast, Peter Drake is portrayed quite realistically, as he and a cast of “everyday heroes and heroines," including General Grant and Lianne Starling, deal with some extraordinary circumstances, tough times, action-packed scenes, and high drama. Sympathetic characters as well as despicable ones float in and out, yet ultimately, the main intrigue of the story concerns the complex relationships and dynamic interactions that occur between the good guys and the bad.

    ('For centuries, parasites have lived in nightmares, horror stories, and in the darkest shadows of science. Now award-winning writer Carl Zimmer takes us on a fantastic voyage into the secret parasite universe we actually live in but haven''t recognized. He reveals not only that parasites are the most successful life-forms on Earth, but that they triggered the development of sex, shape ecosystems, and have driven the engine of evolution. In mapping the parasite universe, Zimmer makes the astonishing observation that most species are parasites, and that almost every animal, including humans, will at one time or another become the home of a parasite. Zimmer shows how highly evolved parasites are and describes the frightening and amazing ingenuity these commando invaders use to devour their hosts from the inside and control their behavior. The sinister Sacculina carcini makes its home in an unlucky crab and proceeds to eat everything but what the crab needs to put food in its mouth, which Sacculina then consumes. When Sacculina finally reproduces, it places its young precisely where the crab would nurture its own progeny, and then has the crab nurture the foster family members. Single-celled Toxoplasma gondi has an even more insidious role, for it can invade the human brain. There it makes men distrustful and less willing to submit to social mores. Women become more outgoing and warm-hearted. Why would a parasite cause these particular personality changes? It seems Toxoplasma wants its host to be less afraid, to be more prone to danger and a violent end -- so that, in the carnage, it will be able to move on to another host. From the steamy jungles of Costa Rica to the fetid parasite heaven of rebel-held southern Sudan, Zimmer tracks the genius of parasitic life and its impact on humanity. We hosts have developed remarkable defenses against the indomitable parasite: our mighty immune system, our culturally enforced habit of keeping clean, and, perhaps most intriguingly, sex. But this is not merely a book about the evil power of parasitism and how we must defend against it. On the contrary, Zimmer concludes that humankind itself is a new kind of parasite, one that preys on the entire Earth. If we are to achieve the sophistication of the parasites on display here in vivid detail, if we are to promote the flourishing of life in all its diversity as they do, we must learn the ways nature lives with itself, the laws of Parasite Rex.','With a New Epilogue','Paperback','9.78074E+12',306,4.17,4259,'Parasite Rex: Inside the Bizarre World of Nature''s Most Dangerous Creatures','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1390166830l/815394.jpg','b2300',31.91),

Ci sono buone ragioni se i versi del poeta oscillano tra la più intensa tenerezza e parossismi di indifferenza, e se da queste oscillazioni nasce uno stridente lirismo che non ha precedenti». Così scrive Brodskij presentando queste dieci poesie di W.H. Auden. Composte negli anni Trenta, e impregnate di un angoscioso «odore del futuro», esse parlano dell’amore nella varietà dei suoi stati, dall’esaltazione alla desolazione. Con un vago tono di ballata sul fondo, e quasi sfidando una musica a seguirli, questi versi hanno un «timbro tagliente» che incide le parole nella mente annientando ogni ostacolo.

After twenty years under the Pygmalion-like direction of his older partner Walter, Aaron at last decides it is time to stop letting life happen to him and to take control of his own fate. But soon after establishing himself in San Francisco—where he alternates between a shoddy garage apartment and the absurdly ramshackle ESL school where he teaches—Aaron sees that real freedom will not come until he has made peace with his memories of Morton, Minnesota: a cramped town whose four hundred souls form a constellation of Aaron’s childhood heartbreaks and hopes.After Aaron’s father died in the town parade, it was the larger-than-life misfits of his childhood—sardonic, wheel-chair bound dwarf named Clarence, a generous, obese baker named Bernice, a kindly aunt preoccupied with dreams of The Rapture—who helped Aaron find his place in a provincial world hostile to difference. But Aaron’s sense of rejection runs deep: when Aaron was seventeen, Dolores—Aaron’s loving, selfish, and enigmatic mother—vanished one night with the town pastor.

The greatest warrior of his day, and witness to the greatest defeat of his nation: King Janus’s vision of a Greater Unified Realm drowned in the blood of brave men fighting for a cause Vaelin alone knows was forged from a lie. Sick at heart, he comes home, determined to kill no more.

It tells the story of a young girl, fresh from the provinces, whose initiation into the ways of the world is frequently painful, though it leads to self-discovery, moral growth, and, finally, happiness. Hilarious comedy and moral gravity make the novel a fund of entertainment and wisdom. Out of the graceful shifts from the idyllic to the near-tragic and realistic, Evelina emerges as a fully realized character. And out of its treatment of contrasts - the peace of the countryside and the cultured and social excitement of London and Bristol, the crowd of life-like vulgarians and the elegant gentry - the novel reveals superbly the life and temper of eighteenth-century England, as seen through the curious eyes of its young heroine.

He meets a one-eyed giant, Polyphemus the Cyclops; he visits the underworld; he faces the terrible monsters Scylla and Charybdis; he extricates himself from the charms of Circe and Calypso. After these and numerous other legendary encounters he finally reaches home, where, disguised as a beggar, he begins to plan revenge on the suitors who have for years been besieging Penelope and feasting on his own meat and wine with insolent impunity.','Norton Critical Edition','Paperback','9.78039E+12',414,3.74,767187,'The Odyssey','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1386919431l/267754.jpg','b2367',19.9),

A confession and manifesto from a senior leader in the emerging church movement. A Generous Orthodoxycalls for a radical, Christ-centered orthodoxy of faith and practice in a missional, generous spirit. Brian McLaren argues for a post-liberal, post-conservative, post-protestant convergence, which will stimulate lively interest and global conversation among thoughtful Christians from all traditions. In a sweeping exploration of belief, author Brian McLaren takes us across the landscape of faith, envisioning an orthodoxy that aims for Jesus, is driven by love, and is defined by missional intent. A Generous Orthodoxy rediscovers the mysterious and compelling ways that Jesus can be embraced across the entire Christian horizon. Rather than establishing what is and is not “orthodox,” McLaren walks through the many traditions of faith, bringing to the center a way of life that draws us closer to Christ and to each other. Whether you find yourself inside, outside, or somewhere on the fringe of Christianity, A Generous Orthodoxy draws you toward a way of living that looks beyond the “us/them” paradigm to the blessed and ancient paradox of “we.” Also available on abridged audio CD, read by the author.','Abridged','Paperback','9.78031E+12',348,3.71,5035,'A Generous Orthodoxy: Why I am a missional, evangelical, post/protestant, liberal/conservative, mystical/poetic, biblical, charismatic/contemplative, fundamentalist/calvinist, anabaptist/anglican, methodist, catholic, green, incarnational, depressed-ye...','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1384949537l/87664.jpg','b2370',25.09),
    ('La novela El Señor Presidente se llamó primero Los mendigos políticos. Era un cuento que Miguel Ángel Asturias ya tenía escrito cuando en 1923 partió de Guatemala para instalarse en Europa. Asturias había sido testigo desde muy joven de la situación de desigualdad entre las clases, de la explotación injusta del campesinado y de la sensación palpable del miedo a los horrores de las dictaduras, pero no comprendía aún las razones por las que tales circunstancias existían y cuál era la forma de conjurar la situación. Fue en Europa donde tomó conciencia de los valores escondidos en la cultura tradicional de los "hombres de maíz". Y fueron muchos los pasos que tuvo que dar en su larga preparación de ilustración universal, de confrontación de ideas y estilos, para que siguiendo el consejo que le diera Paul Valéry llegara a describir a su pueblo para ser universal. Así se produjo la larga gestación de El Señor Presidente, que por encima de su condición de novela-denuncia trasciende los ecos surgidos en la memoria colectiva a partir de la resonancia natural de las palabras, las fantasías oníricas asimiladas de manera gradual por la realidad de la vida.','6th edition','Paperback','9.78844E+12',428,3.99,2809,'El Señor Presidente','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1376424137l/327281.jpg','b2371',38.65),

Sin embargo, las extensiones tecnológicas de la conciencia humana se adelantaban a nuestra capacidad para comprender consecuencias, nunca ha sido tan apremiante. Y si el medio es el mensaje, el mensaje se está volviendo casi imposible de descifrar. En La Aldea Global, McLuhan y el coautor Bruce R. Powers proponen un marco conceptual detallado en cuyos términos pueden comprenderse los avances tecnológicos de las dos últimas teoría, se encuentra el argumento de que los usuarios de la tecnología están atrapados por dos formas distintas de percibir el mundo. Por un lado, está lo que ellos llaman Espacio Visual (la forma de percepción lineal, cuantitativa, característica del mundo occidental); por el otro, el Espacio Acústico (el razonamiento holístico, cualitativo, de Oriente). Los autores sostienen que el medio impreso estimula y conserva la percepción del espacio visual; sin embargo, al igual que la televisión, la tecnología de la base de datos, el satélite de comunicaciones y la red global de medios de comunicación están llevando a sus usuarios hacia una orientación más dinámica y "con muchos núcleos" del Espacio Acústico. Los autores nos advierten que este movimiento hacia el Espacio Acústico puede no ser gradual. De hecho, McLuhan y Powers sostienen que con el advenimiento de la globalización del entorno (el resultado de las comunicaciones mundiales) estos dos puntos de vista mundiales "están chocando a la velocidad de la luz" y aseguran que la "clave para la paz es comprender estos dos sistemas en forma simultánea". Al emplear el concepto de McLuhan del tétrade (una figura para predecir los cambios causados por nuevas tecnologías), los autores analizan esta colisión de puntos de vista.

But none of that could have prepared him for how his life is forever changed one fateful spring day when he rescues a very battered young woman. Together with his men, they risk everything to take her to the safety of their clan. She soon learns that kind and honorable men do exist and one in particular changes her heart forever. She discovers an inner strength and it will be tested to the limits when she is forced to make a heart wrenching decision--allow the English to kill those she loves or surrender for the crime she committed. With an intense code of honor Duncan must now battle the feelings for the beautiful Aishlinn. He will do anything to keep her as his own and he''ll do anything to keep her out of the hands of the English.','First Edition','Paperback','9.78147E+12',240,3.94,3367,'Laiden''s Daughter','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1336863884l/13488738.jpg','b2394',13.62),

It feels good in your hands: a true work of art, a collector’s dream.But then you notice something wrong. There’s a stain on the cover. And it is there on purpose. It’s a coffee ring printed onto the cover with gloss laminate.This book, the debut effort by cult cartoonist Dave Strider, was realized with the help of a dedicated team of experienced artists.

Homestuck creator Andrew Hussie (mspaintadventures.com) served as consultant.Since the days of Gutenberg, publishers have tried to marry form with content in pleasing and impressive ways. And while there have been fancy books, and there have been bad books, never before in the history of the codex have the two been mismatched in so dramatic and pointless a fashion.

Ebbene, qui Maggiani fa un passo avanti e imbocca con rabbia e ardore la via dell’invettiva – un’oralità che sale di volume e di passione oratoria, perché, senza meno, deve ottenere un risultato: andare a segno.

In trying to explain who he was and how he came to be the object of others'' admiration and abuse, Rousseau analyses with unique insight the relationship between an elusive but essential inner self and the variety of social identities he was led to adopt. The book vividly illustrates the mixture of moods and motives that underlie the writing of autobiography: defiance and vulnerability, self-exploration and denial, passion, puzzlement, and detachment.

    ('In his new book, Gurcharan Das turns to the Mahabharata in order to answer the question, "why be good'''', and discovers that the epic''s world of moral haziness and uncertainty is closer to our experience as ordinary human beings than the narrow and rigid positions that define most debate in this fundamentalist age of moral certainty. The Mahabharata is obsessed with the elusive notion of dharma - in essence, doing the right thing. When a hero falters, the action stops and everyone weighs in with a different and often contradictory take on dharma. The epic''s characters are flawed, but their incoherent experiences throw light on our familiar dilemmas. Gurcharan Das''s best-selling book India Unbound examined the classical aim of artha, material well being. This, his first book in seven years, dwells on the goal of dharma, moral well being. It addresses the central problem of how to live our lives in an examined way - holding a mirror up to us and forcing us to confront the many ways in which we deceive ourselves and others. What emerges is a doctrine of dharma that we can apply to our business decisions, political strategies and interpersonal relationships - in effect, to life itself.','Royal','Hardcover','9.78067E+12',488,4.07,3213,'The Difficulty of Being Good: On the Subtle Art of Dharma','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348009106l/6971900.jpg','b2429',34.47),

    ('Questo romanzo, in larga parte autobiografico, si sarebbe potuto anche intitolare Missione impossibile e il perché lo comprenderete con le righe che seguono.La vicenda prende origine dal disastro minerario di Ribolla nel 1954, in cui perirono 43 minatori, per negligenza, ma soprattutto per calcoli di economia del padronato in cui il valore di una vita umana non rientrava minimamente.E’ così che il protagonista, nel desiderio di vendicare quegli innocenti, da buon anarchico vuole colpire il simbolo del potere che si annida in un palazzone di Milano, il torracchione, da far saltare con una giusta combinazione di aria e metano, proprio come era avvenuto per lo scoppio di grisù in miniera.Il proposito è ardito, la volontà è salda, ma la grande città è un mostro che piano piano ingloba, appiattisce, distrugge la vita e gli ideali.Nemmeno il desiderio di coinvolgere i suoi cittadini schiavi in un moto di ribellione (bellissima la descrizione delle partenze degli operai alla sera dalla stazione Centrale di Milano) può trovare sbocco, perché in quei sudditi l’appiattimento si è trasformato in apatia e l’abitudine in rassegnazione, anzi è gente che crede di poter convivere con il mostro che li asservisce.E’ un’umanità impersonale, quasi i suoi componenti non avessero il volto, oppure questo è sistematicamente eguale fra le donne, una sorta di automi inaciditi e invecchiati prima del tempo, a cui al massimo è concessa la facoltà di far le scarpe agli altri, in una modesta carriera che assomiglia a uno scontro quotidiano. Solo una appare non inglobata, quella Anna di cui lui, già sposato con Mara rimasta al paese con il pargolo, si innamora perdutamente, per reazione e perché tanta è la differenza rispetto alle altre.In concomitanza con la conoscenza di questa compagna di vita iniziano le pagine più autenticamente rivoluzionarie con una visione libera totalmente della vita sessuale, con un richiamo forte a un amore fisico secondo natura, scevro dall’ossessiva pubblicità che sembra dare e invece toglie tutto, in una satira della classe dirigente come prima non si era mai scritta.Nell’attesa, sempre più disillusa, di arrivare a far saltare non solo il torracchione, ma il coperchio di potere che schiaccia la città, il protagonista, per mantenere sé, la sua compagna e la famiglia, è costretto a lavorare, a fare il traduttore di testi letterari che, nella realtà, come ebbe a dire Bianciardi, divenne poi la sua effettiva occupazione.E’ un lavoro duro, non valutato adeguatamente, in cui un intellettuale preparato, impegnato ore e ore, finisce presto in preda all’amarezza, a quella vita agra che dà il titolo al libro. Sono pagine intense, anche di profonda commozione e che riescono a dare la misura del disagio esistenziale. Al riguardo mi permetto di citare due righe, non di più, ma ampiamente sufficienti per comprendere l’agro della vita: “Non è un mestiere avventuroso; le sue gioie e i suoi dolori dall’esterno si vedono assai poco.”.E’ la disgregazione di un ideale, è una rassegnazione che si spegne dentro, con un finale profondamente triste: l’anarchico, in origine saldo, determinato, pieno di ardore, è stato avvinto dai tentacoli di quel sistema che lui voleva scardinare.La sua è stata solo una missione impossibile.','6 ed.

Nonetheless, it is a form beloved and practice by literature''s greatest writers. In the ART OF THE NOVELLA series, Melville House celebrates this renegade art form and its practitioners with titles that are, in many instances, presented in book form for the first time.With an attention to the details of bourgeois life considered almost scandalous at the time, A Simple Heart will remind many why Gustave Flaubert was acclaimed as the first great master of realism. But this heart-breaking tale of a simple servant woman and her life-long search for love meant something else to Flaubert. Written near the end of his life, the work was meant to be a tribute to George Sand—who died before it was finished—and was written in answer to an argument the two were having over the importance of realism. Although the tale displays his virtuosic gift for telling detail, and is based on one of his actual servants, Flaubert said it exemplified his belief that "Beauty is the object of all my efforts."

Aisladas en sus casas y sometidas a la férrea autoridad masculina, el nu shu era su única vía de escape.

    ('The work of Giorgio Agamben, one of Italy’s most important and original philosophers, has been based on an uncommon erudition in classical traditions of philosophy and rhetoric, the grammarians of late antiquity, Christian theology, and modern philosophy. Recently, Agamben has begun to direct his thinking to the constitution of the social and to some concrete, ethico-political conclusions concerning the state of society today, and the place of the individual within it.In Homo Sacer, Agamben aims to connect the problem of pure possibility, potentiality, and power with the problem of political and social ethics in a context where the latter has lost its previous religious, metaphysical, and cultural grounding. Taking his cue from Foucault’s fragmentary analysis of biopolitics, Agamben probes with great breadth, intensity, and acuteness the covert or implicit presence of an idea of biopolitics in the history of traditional political theory. He argues that from the earliest treatises of political theory, notably in Aristotle’s notion of man as a political animal, and throughout the history of Western thinking about sovereignty (whether of the king or the state), a notion of sovereignty as power over “life” is implicit.The reason it remains merely implicit has to do, according to Agamben, with the way the sacred, or the idea of sacrality, becomes indissociable from the idea of sovereignty. Drawing upon Carl Schmitt’s idea of the sovereign’s status as the exception to the rules he safeguards, and on anthropological research that reveals the close interlinking of the sacred and the taboo, Agamben defines the sacred person as one who can be killed and yet not sacrificed—a paradox he sees as operative in the status of the modern individual living in a system that exerts control over the collective “naked life” of all individuals.','1st edition Meridian: Crossing Aesthetics','Paperback','9.7808E+12',208,4.02,3461,'Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1296857435l/85826.jpg','b2483',45.38),

Directly challenging common perceptions about gun control, legal scholar John Lott presents the most rigorously comprehensive data analysis ever done on crime statistics and right-to-carry laws.

In this paperback edition, Lott has expanded the research through 1996, incorporating new data available from states that passed right-to-carry and other gun laws since the book''s publication as well as new city-level statistics.“Lott''s pro-gun argument has to be examined on the merits, and its chief merit is lots of data…If you still disagree with Lott, at least you will know what will be required to rebut a case that looks pretty near bulletproof.”—Peter Coy, Business Week“By providing strong empirical evidence that yet another liberal policy is a cause of the very evil it purports to cure, he has permanently changed the terms of debate on gun control…Lott''s book could hardly be more timely… A model of the meticulous application of economics and statistics to law and policy.”—John O.

It was to this impregnable fortress that the Germans sent all those prisoners who persisted in escaping from other camps, such as Stalag Luft III (of THE GREAT ESCAPE FAME). Once within the walls of Colditz, the Germans reasoned, escape was impossible. And yet during the four-year period when the castle was used as a prison over 300 men escaped, 31 of whom managed to complete the hazardous journey home through Germany. Prisoners from 10 different countries formed a truly international escape academy. Skeleton keys were made, German passes forged, maps drafted, and all manner of tools and machinery constructed out of whatever the prisoners had to hand.

    ('Some books improve with age--the age of the reader, that is. Such is certainly the case with Philip Pullman''s heroic, at times heart-wrenching novel, The Golden Compass, a story ostensibly for children but one perhaps even better appreciated by adults. The protagonist of this complex fantasy is young Lyra Belacqua, a precocious orphan growing up within the precincts of Oxford University. But it quickly becomes clear that Lyra''s Oxford is not precisely like our own--nor is her world. For one thing, people there each have a personal dæmon, the manifestation of their soul in animal form. For another, hers is a universe in which science, theology, and magic are closely allied:  As for what experimental theology was, Lyra had no more idea than the urchins. She had formed the notion that it was concerned with magic, with the movements of the stars and planets, with tiny particles of matter, but that was guesswork, really. Probably the stars had dæmons just as humans did, and experimental theology involved talking to them.  Not that Lyra spends much time worrying about it; what she likes best is "clambering over the College roofs with Roger the kitchen boy who was her particular friend, to spit plum stones on the heads of passing Scholars or to hoot like owls outside a window where a tutorial was going on, or racing through the narrow streets, or stealing apples from the market, or waging war." But Lyra''s carefree existence changes forever when she and her dæmon, Pantalaimon, first prevent an assassination attempt against her uncle, the powerful Lord Asriel, and then overhear a secret discussion about a mysterious entity known as Dust. Soon she and Pan are swept up in a dangerous game involving disappearing children, a beautiful woman with a golden monkey dæmon, a trip to the far north, and a set of allies ranging from "gyptians" to witches to an armor-clad polar bear.  In The Golden Compass, Philip Pullman has written a masterpiece that transcends genre. It is a children''s book that will appeal to adults, a fantasy novel that will charm even the most hardened realist. Best of all, the author doesn''t speak down to his audience, nor does he pull his punches; there is genuine terror in this book, and heartbreak, betrayal, and loss. There is also love, loyalty, and an abiding morality that infuses the story but never overwhelms it. This is one of those rare novels that one wishes would never end.

    ('For the past forty years shamanism has drawn increasing attention among the general public and academics. There is an enormous literature on shamanism, but no one has tried to understand why and how Western intellectual and popular culture became so fascinated with the topic. Behind fictional and non-fictional works on shamanism, Andrei A. Znamenski uncovers an exciting story that mirrors changing Western attitudes toward the primitive. The Beauty of the Primitive explores how shamanism, an obscure word introduced by the eighteenth-century German explorers of Siberia, entered Western humanities and social sciences, and has now become a powerful idiom used by nature and pagan communities to situate their spiritual quests and anti-modernity sentiments. The major characters of The Beauty of the Primitive are past and present Western scholars, writers, explorers, and spiritual seekers with a variety of views on shamanism. Moving from Enlightenment and Romantic writers and Russian exile ethnographers to the anthropology of Franz Boas to Mircea Eliade and Carlos Castaneda, Znamenski details how the shamanism idiom was gradually transplanted from Siberia to the Native American scene and beyond. He also looks into the circumstances that prompted scholars and writers at first to marginalize shamanism as a mental disorder and then to recast it as high spiritual wisdom in the 1960s and the 1970s. Linking the growing interest in shamanism to the rise of anti-modernism in Western culture and intellectual life, Znamenski examines the role that anthropology, psychology, environmentalism, and Native Americana have played in the emergence of neo-shamanism. He discusses the sources that inspire Western neo-shamans and seeks to explain why lately many of these spiritual seekers have increasingly moved away from non-Western tradition to European folklore. A work of intellectual discovery, The Beauty of the Primitive shows how scholars, writers, and spiritual seekers shape their writings and experiences to suit contemporary cultural, ideological, and spiritual needs. With its interdisciplinary approach and engaging style, it promises to be the definitive account of this neglected strand of intellectual history.','1st edition','Hardcover','9.7802E+12',434,4.21,14,'The Beauty of the Primitive: Shamanism and the Western Imagination','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347709384l/1274483.jpg','b2529',20.05),

    ('Arianna ha appena compiuto trentatré anni, ma il suo temperamento è ancora deliziosamente infantile.Quando Giulio la incontra, in un giorno triste per entrambi, è subito conquistato da questa creatura smarrita, selvatica come una bimba abbandonata eppure bellissima e sensuale. Arianna entra nella sua vita con una naturalezza che lo strega, e dal giorno in cui la sposa Giulio cerca di restituirle la luce che lei gli ha portato offrendole tutto ciò che potrebbe desiderare: anche quello che lui, a causa di un grave incidente, non può più darle... Così della loro routine entrano presto a far parte gli appuntamenti del giovedì, meticolosamente organizzati da Giulio in persona: in un pied-à-terre appartato o in una cabina sulla spiaggia, secondo la stagione, gli uomini destinati a incontrare Arianna sono tenuti a rispettare poche regole inviolabili.Nella vita di questa coppia, dunque, segreti non ce ne sono. Ogni tanto, però, Giulio è attraversato dalla consapevolezza che qualcosa gli sfugge: "Tu non mi hai detto tutto di te" le sussurra mentre non riesce a fare a meno di viziarla. È così. Di segreti Arianna ne ha molti, e brucianti - tanto che forse nemmeno lei ne conserva un ricordo nitido. Ma quello che custodisce più gelosamente è il "tuttomio": una "tana" tutta sua, ricavata in un angolo del solaio, come la piccola caverna dove si rifugiava da bambina, in campagna.Ed è lì, nel tuttomio, che Arianna si confida con la sua unica vera amica, Stefania.I giochi di Arianna e Giulio sono troppo torbidi e coinvolgenti per non farsi, con il passare del tempo, pericolosi. Tanto più perché lei, come ogni bambina, non ha chiaro il confine che separa il gioco dalla realtà. E può bastare lo sguardo di un ragazzino ingenuo e focoso, a cui è difficile dire di no, perché le regole rischino di essere infrante e un vento sinistro porti scompiglio nella casa di bambola che Giulio ha costruito.Ispirato alla scandalosa vicenda dei marchesi Casati Stampa, ma anche percorso da una fitta trama di rimandi a grandi classici come Santuario di Faulkner e L''amante di Lady Chatterley di Lawrence, questo romanzo mette in scena una protagonista femminile straordinaria: inquietante nel suo candore, splen- dente di una luce nerissima. Quando abbandona la lingua mescidata dei suoi romanzi siciliani, Camilleri dispiega una scrittura magistralmente essenziale, limpidissima - verrebbe da dire spietata - eppure priva di inibizioni. Un gioco raffinato e colmo di ironia, con il quale trascina i lettori attraverso il labirinto dell''eros, al cuore dell''amore e della perdizione, là dove - come nel mito di Arianna - il Minotauro vive nutrendosi dei desideri più oscuri e inconfessabili.Un romanzo che si legge d''un fiato, terribile e sorprendente.','Scrittori italiani e stranieri','Hardcover','9.7888E+12',147,2.77,162,'Il Tuttomio','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1357659390l/17227353.jpg','b2536',13.28),

Performing as a living statue in a wedding dress, she wordlessly asked thousands of passersby for their dollars. When she became a singer, songwriter, and musician, she was not afraid to ask her audience to support her as she surfed the crowd (and slept on their couches while touring). And when she left her record label to strike out on her own, she asked her fans to support her in making an album, leading to the world''s most successful music Kickstarter.Even while Amanda is both celebrated and attacked for her fearlessness in asking for help, she finds that there are important things she cannot ask for-as a musician, as a friend, and as a wife. She learns that she isn''t alone in this, that so many people are afraid to ask for help, and it paralyzes their lives and relationships.

Chief Minister to Henry VIII, his fortunes have risen with those of Anne Boleyn, Henry''s second wife, for whose sake Henry has broken with Rome and created his own church. But Henry''s actions have forced England into dangerous isolation, and Anne has failed to do what she promised: bear a son to secure the Tudor line. When Henry visits Wolf Hall, Cromwell watches as he falls in love with the silent, plain Jane Seymour. The minister sees what is at stake: not just the king''s pleasure, but the safety of the nation. As he eases a way through the sexual politics of the court, its miasma of gossip, he must negotiate a ''truth'' that will satisfy Henry and secure his own career.

    ('Before Joseph Campbell became the world''s most famous practitioner of comparative mythology, there was Sir James George Frazer. The Golden Bough was originally published in two volumes in 1890, but Frazer became so enamored of his topic that over the next few decades he expanded the work sixfold, then in 1922 cut it all down to a single thick edition suitable for mass distribution. The thesis on the origins of magic and religion that it elaborates "will be long and laborious," Frazer warns readers, "but may possess something of the charm of a voyage of discovery, in which we shall visit many strange lands, with strange foreign peoples, and still stranger customs." Chief among those customs--at least as the book is remembered in the popular imagination--is the sacrificial killing of god-kings to ensure bountiful harvests, which Frazer traces through several cultures, including in his elaborations the myths of Adonis, Osiris, and Balder. While highly influential in its day, The Golden Bough has come under harsh critical scrutiny in subsequent decades, with many of its descriptions of regional folklore and legends deemed less than reliable. Furthermore, much of its tone is rooted in a philosophy of social Darwinism--sheer cultural imperialism, really--that finds its most explicit form in Frazer''s rhetorical question: "If in the most backward state of human society now known to us we find magic thus conspicuously present and religion conspicuously absent, may we not reasonably conjecture that the civilised races of the world have also at some period of their history passed through a similar intellectual phase?" (The truly civilized races, he goes on to say later, though not particularly loudly, are the ones whose minds evolve beyond religious belief to embrace the rational structures of scientific thought.) Frazer was much too genteel to state plainly that "primitive" races believe in magic because they are too stupid and backwards to know any better; instead he remarks that "a savage hardly conceives the distinction commonly drawn by more advanced peoples between the natural and the supernatural." And he certainly was not about to make explicit the logical extension of his theories--"that Christian legend, dogma, and ritual" (to quote Robert Graves''s summation of Frazer in The White Goddess) "are the refinement of a great body of primitive and barbarous beliefs." Whatever modern readers have come to think of the book, however, its historical significance and the eloquence with which Frazer attempts to develop what one might call a unifying theory of anthropology cannot be denied. --Ron Hogan','Abridged','Paperback','9.78068E+12',880,4.02,7138,'The Golden Bough','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1174504446l/408862.jpg','b2542',41.8),

    ('More than 27 million Americans today can trace their lineage to the Scots, whose bloodline was stained by centuries of continuous warfare along the border between England and Scotland, and later in the bitter settlements of England’s Ulster Plantation in Northern Ireland. Between 250,000 and 400,000 Scots-Irish migrated to America in the eighteenth century, traveling in groups of families and bringing with them not only long experience as rebels and outcasts but also unparalleled skills as frontiersmen and guerrilla fighters. Their cultural identity reflected acute individualism, dislike of aristocracy and a military tradition, and, over time, the Scots-Irish defined the attitudes and values of the military, of working class America, and even of the peculiarly populist form of American democracy itself. Born Fighting is the first book to chronicle the full journey of this remarkable cultural group, and the profound, but unrecognized, role it has played in the shaping of America. Written with the storytelling verve that has earned his works such acclaim as “captivating . . . unforgettable” (the Wall Street Journal on Lost Soliders), Scots-Irishman James Webb, Vietnam combat veteran and former Naval Secretary, traces the history of his people, beginning nearly two thousand years ago at Hadrian’s Wall, when the nation of Scotland was formed north of the Wall through armed conflict in contrast to England’s formation to the south through commerce and trade. Webb recounts the Scots’ odyssey—their clashes with the English in Scotland and then in Ulster, their retreat from one war-ravaged land to another. Through engrossing chronicles of the challenges the Scots-Irish faced, Webb vividly portrays how they developed the qualities that helped settle the American frontier and define the American character. Born Fighting shows that the Scots-Irish were 40 percent of the Revolutionary War army; they included the pioneers Daniel Boone, Lewis and Clark, Davy Crockett, and Sam Houston; they were the writers Edgar Allan Poe and Mark Twain; and they have given America numerous great military leaders, including Stonewall Jackson, Ulysses S. Grant, Audie Murphy, and George S. Patton, as well as most of the soldiers of the Confederacy (only 5 percent of whom owned slaves, and who fought against what they viewed as an invading army). It illustrates how the Scots-Irish redefined American politics, creating the populist movement and giving the country a dozen presidents, including Andrew Jackson, Teddy Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Ronald Reagan, and Bill Clinton. And it explores how the Scots-Irish culture of isolation, hard luck, stubbornness, and mistrust of the nation’s elite formed and still dominates blue-collar America, the military services, the Bible Belt, and country music. Both a distinguished work of cultural history and a human drama that speaks straight to the heart of contemporary America, Born Fighting reintroduces America to its most powerful, patriotic, and individualistic cultural group—one too often ignored or taken for granted.','Expanded Edition','Paperback','9.78077E+12',400,3.79,1220,'Born Fighting: How the Scots-Irish Shaped America','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388209350l/223428.jpg','b2570',41.67),

In both his essays and his fiction, Albert Camus (1913—1960) de-ployed his lyric eloquence in defense against despair, providing an affirmation of the brave assertion of humanity in the face of a universe devoid of order or meaning.The Plague–written in 1947 and still profoundly relevant–is a riveting tale of horror, survival, and resilience in the face of a devastating epidemic. The Fall (1956), which takes the form of an astonishing confession by a French lawyer in a seedy Amsterdam bar, is a haunting parable of modern conscience in the face of evil. The six stories of Exile and the Kingdom (1957) represent Camus at the height of his narrative powers, masterfully depicting his characters–from a renegade missionary to an adulterous wife –at decisive moments of revelation.

It is a satirical comedy sharply focussed on the follies, vices and hypocrisies of Restoration London through its central characters: the desperate Pinchwife; his naive wife; the sex-obsessed Horner and Lady Fidget''s ''virtuous gang'' of town ladies.Wycherley''s strong wit informs almost every speech and his alarmingly familiar revelations of character leave us to draw our own conclusions. It remains a controversial play, admired as satire or farce, condemned as immoral and frivolous, and appreciated again as a serious work of dramatic art. Modern critics have much debated its central themes, and question marks remain: is Horner hero or villain?This student edition contains a fully annotated version of the playtext in modern spelling.

    ('Tired of working undercover narcotics, police detective Ken Goode wants a transfer to homicide. After the Camus-reading surfer finds the body of a beautiful woman in an alley, he is assigned to head a team of relief detectives with the hopes of proving he is homicide-worthy. As Goode explores the underbelly of the affluent coastal enclave of La Jolla, California, and its hipster neighbor, Pacific Beach, he clashes with the patrons and employees of a neighborhood bar: real estate agents and beauty school students who have possible ties to an escort service and a drug ring – and keep turning up dead. The untimely disappearance of Goode’s sister proves a worrisome distraction as he chases suspects and a dogged cub reporter chases him. In this intricately-layered plot, Rother’s characters use substances or other people to try to fill the empty spaces within themselves, with addictions ranging from sex, alcohol, cocaine and cigarettes to Goode’s own, caffeine and damaged women.','Revised and Updated','Paperback','9.78099E+12',417,4.02,66,'Naked Addiction','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1415306990l/23509377.jpg','b2589',18.87),

    ('Renowned as a wit, poet, dramatist and one of the great conversationalists of his age, Oscar Wilde (1854–1900) nevertheless fell victim to the forces of repression and prudery in late Victorian England. As a result of his affair with Lord Alfred Douglas, Wilde was found guilty of homosexual offenses and jailed for two years.While in prison, he wrote De Profundis, a long and bitter letter of recrimination addressed to Douglas. In it, he accuses Douglas of shallowness, selfishness, greed, gross interference with his [Wilde''s] artistic efforts and other faults and wrongdoing. Nevertheless, it is clear from this letter that Wilde deeply loved Douglas and still harbored strong feelings for him, in spite of Douglas'' role in Wilde''s downfall. While the letter is a touching cri de coeur that offers fascinating insights into Wilde''s life in prison and the background and psychology of a notorious affair, its eloquence, passion, and literary excellence raise it above the level of the purely personal. Instead, it becomes a universal statement about love, injustice and the pain of living in the world.','Dover Thrift Editions','Paperback','9.78049E+12',96,4.18,8430,'De Profundis','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1416873254l/752993.jpg','b2592',20.16),

    ('1848 március 13-án az egész város felbolydult Bécsben. Richárd is ott van a bécsi utcákon. Egymásnak ellentmondó parancsokat kap, ezért nem használja, csak a kardja lapját, nem gyilkol, csak szétkergeti a csőcseléket. Jenő, aki soha életében nem fogott kardot, egyik erkélyről Ödönt hallja beszélni, ami megrémíti és eszébe jut, hogy ez a második lépcső ama magaslathoz. A forradalom minden történelmi korban izgalmas. A magyar történelemben a negyvennyolcas szabadságharc mérföldkő, kivételes nemzedéket hozott magával. Sajátos közép-kelet-európai helyzet, hogy a politika szabta feladatok terhe a szépírókra hárul, így a nagy nemzedék művészi tevékenysége összefonódik a közéleti szerepvállalással. A nemzetet bátorítani kell, hosszabb ideig vigasztalni, de leginkább elbódítani nagy eszmékkel, a dicső múlttal. Jókai, az elnyomatás korában a nemzet bánatát hosszasan vigasztalandó, fölhasználja a romantika minden eszközét. A Kőszívű ember fiai témája a nemzeti függetlenségért vívott harc körül bonyolódik, mely függetlenséghez a szerzőnek az a nem egészen illúziómentes elképzelése fűződik, hogy a hazai kultúra fellendülését hozza. Nem hozta. Ugyanakkor önálló hadseregről és független gazdasági életről álmodik, melyekről Világos mutatta meg világosan, hogy nem kivitelezhető. A szövevényes cselekményű regény ezeket a kérdéseket feszegeti a Baradlayak levegőjével körülvéve. A Baradlay-fiúk eszményi hősök, mindhárman a maguk módján vívnak a reakció ellen, apjuk kőszívű végrendeletének árnyékában. A reformkor, a forradalom és a megtorlás korának hangulatát pontos, finom rajzzal adja át Jókai. Richárd alakját egyenesen Kölcseyről mintázta. Hősöket, árulókat, komformistákat és csalókat látunk, miközben a háttérben viharzik a történelem. A férje szellemével szembeszálló, aggódó édesanya, a csodaszép és tisztalelkű hajadon, az anyjával közösen mesterkedő, eladósorban levő leány portréja a női sorsok skáláját színesítik. És a szerző által a nemzet ellenségeként számon tartott germanizálódás veszélye ezúttal sajátos fordulatot hoz: Baradlay Ödön hivatalosan jegyzett, azaz nem magyar keresztnevének Eugenre tévesztése, magyar megfelelője, Baradlay Jenő számára teszi lehetővé, hogy nemes áldozatot vállaljon. A három testvér erkölcsi győzelme példaértékű. Láttunk már hasonló jelentőségű győzelmet a magyar irodalomban, Zrínyinél. A Kőszívű ember fiai a középiskolások rettegett olvasmánya.

Le giovani coppie che vediamo amoreggiare in una notte primaverile (la Grande Guerra è finita da pochi mesi, e loro sono i fortunati, quelli che alla carneficina delle trincee sono riusciti a sopravvivere) hanno, apparentemente, un solo desiderio: godere, in una immediatezza senza domani, ignorando «il lato sordido» della vita, soffocando «la paura dell''ombra». Eppure, quasi sulla soglia del romanzo, uno dei protagonisti si pone una domanda - «Come avviene, nel matrimonio, il passaggio dall''amore all''amicizia? Quando si smette di tormentarsi a vicenda e si comincia finalmente a volersi bene?» - che ne costituirà il filo conduttore.

Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan has therefore translated the Sefer Yetzirah the oldest and most mysterious of all kabbalistic texts, and now brings its theoretical, meditative and magical implication to light. He expounds on the dynamics of the spiritual domain, the worlds of the Sefirot, souls and angels. When properly understood, the Sefer Yetzirah becomes the instruction manual for a very special type of meditation meant to strengthen concentration, and to aid the development of telekinetic and telepathic powers. These powers were meant to help initiates perform feats that outwardly appeared magical. The magical kabbalah is closely related to the meditative kabbalah, and uses various signs, incantations, and divine names by which initiates could influence or alter natural events.

O livro descreve uma sociedade futura em que as pessoas seriam condicionadas em termos genéticos e psicológicos, a fim de se conformarem com as regras sociais dominantes. Tal sociedade dividir-se-ia em castas e desconheceria os conceitos de família e de moral. Contudo, esse mundo quase irrespirável não deixa de gerar os seus anticorpos. Bernard Marx, o protagonista, sente-se descontente com ele, em parte por ser fisicamente diferente dos restantes membros da sua casta. Então, numa espécie de reserva histórica em que algumas pessoas continuam a viver de acordo com valores e regras do passado, Bernard encontra um jovem que irá apresentar à sociedade asséptica do seu tempo, como um exemplo de outra forma de ser e de viver.

    ('On December 9, 1979, smallpox, the most deadly human virus, ceased to exist in nature. After eradication, it was confined to freezers located in just two places on earth: the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta and the Maximum Containment Laboratory in Siberia. But these final samples were not destroyed at that time, and now secret stockpiles of smallpox surely exist. For example, since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, and the subsequent end of its biological weapons program, a sizeable amount of the former Soviet Union''s smallpox stockpile remains unaccounted for, leading to fears that the virus has fallen into the hands of nations or terrorist groups willing to use it as a weapon. Scarier yet, some may even be trying to develop a strain that is resistant to vaccines. This disturbing reality is the focus of this fascinating, terrifying, and important book. A longtime contributor to The New Yorker and author of the bestseller The Hot Zone, Preston is a skillful journalist whose work flows like a science fiction thriller. Based on extensive interviews with smallpox experts, health workers, and members of the U.S. intelligence community, The Demon in the Freezer details the history and behavior of the virus and how it was eventually isolated and eradicated by the heroic individuals of the World Health Organization. Preston also explains why a battle still rages between those who want to destroy all known stocks of the virus and those who want to keep some samples alive until a cure is found. This is a bitterly contentious point between scientists. Some worry that further testing will trigger a biological arms race, while others argue that more research is necessary since there are currently too few available doses of the vaccine to deal with a major outbreak. The anthrax scare of October, 2001, which Preston also writes about in this book, has served to reinforce the present dangers of biological warfare. As Preston eloquently states in this powerful book, this scourge, once contained, was let loose again due to human weakness: "The virus''s last strategy for survival was to bewitch its host and become a source of power. We could eradicate smallpox from nature, but we could not uproot the virus from the human heart." --Shawn Carkonen','Abridged','Audio CD','9.78038E+12',0,4.11,11291,'The Demon in the Freezer: A True Story','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1185414452l/1577380.jpg','b2674',13.6),

    ('On the twentieth anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, Michael Meyer provides a riveting eyewitness account of the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe that brilliantly rewrites our conventional understanding of how the Cold War came to an end and holds important lessons for America''s current geopolitical challenges." Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!" President Ronald Reagan''s famous exhortation when visiting Berlin in 1987 has long been widely cited as the clarion call that brought the Cold War to an end. The United States won, so this version of history goes, because Ronald Reagan stood firm against the USSR; American resoluteness brought the evil empire to its knees.Michael Meyer, who was there at the time as a Newsweek bureau chief, begs to differ.In this extraordinarily compelling account of the revolutions that roiled Eastern Europe in 1989, he shows that American intransigence was only one of many factors that provoked world-shaking change. Meyer draws together breathtakingly vivid, on-the-ground accounts of the rise of the Solidarity movement in Poland, the stealth opening of the Hungarian border, the Velvet Revolution in Prague and the collapse of the infamous wall in Berlin. But the most important events, Meyer contends, occurred secretly, in the heroic stands taken by individuals in the thick of the struggle, leaders such as poet and playwright Vaclav Havel in Prague; the Baltic shipwright Lech Walesa; the quietly determined reform prime minister in Budapest, Miklos Nemeth; and the man who privately realized that his empire was already lost, and decided -- with courage and intelligence -- to let it go in peace,Soviet general secretary of the communist party, Mikhail Gorbachev.Reporting for Newsweek from the frontlines in Eastern Europe, Meyer spoke to these players and countless others. Alongside their deliberate interventions were also the happenstance and human error of history that are always present when events accelerate to breakneck speed. Meyer captures these heady days in all of their rich drama and unpredictability. In doing so he provides not just a thrilling chronicle of the most important year of the twentieth century but also a crucial refutation of American political mythology and a triumphal misunderstanding of history that seduced the United States into many of the intractable conflicts it faces today.

Uncle Piper is a self-made man who has made his fortune as a butcher; when he sends the fare to Australia to his poor but pretentious relations living in England, the drama begins.Set in Melbourne after the gold rushes of the 1850s, Tasma’s fascinating first novel explores the relationship between birth and wealth, art and experience, women and men. A gripping yarn that expertly evokes a range of characters who must come to terms with the values of the new land, Uncle Piper of Piper’s Hill helped to link the old country with the new and to make a claim for the establishment of Australian literature.','Australian Women Writers: The Literary Heritage','Paperback','9.78086E+12',277,3.0,8,'Uncle Piper of Piper''s Hill','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1318950035l/12906665.jpg','b2693',27.15),
    ('The epic tale of victory and defeat… The story of the Ramayana had been told innumerable times. The enthralling story of Rama, the incarnation of God, who slew Ravana, the evil demon of darkness, is known to every Indian. And in the pages of history, as always, it is the version told by the victors that lives on. The voice of the vanquished remains lost in silence. But what if Ravana and his people had a different story to tell? The story of the Ravanayana has never been told. Asura is the epic tale of the vanquished Asura people, a story that has been cherished by the oppressed castes of India for 3000 years. Until now, no Asura has dared to tell the tale. But perhaps the time has come for the dead and the defeated to speak. “For thousands of years, I have been vilified and my death is celebrated year after year in every corner of India. Why? Was it because I challenged the Gods for the sake of my daughter? Was it because I freed a race from the yoke of caste-based Deva rule? You have heard the victor’s tale, the Ramayana. Now hear the Ravanayana, for I am Ravana, the Asura, and my story is the tale of the vanquished.” “I am a non-entity – invisible, powerless and negligible. No epics will ever be written about me. I have suffered both Ravana and Rama – the hero and the villain or the villain and the hero. When the stories of great men are told, my voice maybe too feeble to be heard. Yet, spare me a moment and hear my story, for I am Bhadra, the Asura, and my life is the tale of the loser.” The ancient Asura empire lay shattered into many warring petty kingdoms reeling under the heel of the Devas. In desperation, the Asuras look up to a young saviour – Ravana. Believing that a better world awaits them under Ravana, common men like Bhadra decide to follow the young leader. With a will of iron and a fiery ambition to succeed, Ravana leads his people from victory to victory and carves out a vast empire from the Devas. But even when Ravana succeeds spectacularly, the poor Asuras find that nothing much has changed from them. It is then that Ravana, by one action, changes the history of the world.','Indian','Paperback','9.78938E+12',504,3.63,8921,'Asura: Tale Of The Vanquished','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1332909772l/13563459.jpg','b2694',26.32),

    ('Per Montale la realtà è segnata da una insanabile frattura fra l''individuo e il mondo, che provoca un senso di frustrazione e di estraneità, un malessere esistenziale. Rispetto a questa visione, la poesia si pone per Montale come espressione profonda e personale della propria ricerca di dignità e del tentativo più alto di comunicare fra gli uomini. L''opera di Montale è, infatti, sempre sorretta da un''intima esigenza di moralità, ma priva di qualunque intenzione moralistica: egli, infatti, non si propone come guida spirituale o morale per gli altri; attraverso la poesia tenta di esprimere la necessità dell''individuo di vivere nel mondo accogliendo con dignità la propria fragilità e la propria debolezza.Il volume racchiude le seguenti raccolte di versi: Ossi di seppia 1920-1927Le occasioni 1928-1939La bufera e altro 1940-1954Satura 1962-1970Diario del ''71 e del ''72 Quaderno di quattro anni Altri versiQuaderno di traduzioni Poesie disperse','Grandi Classici #8','Paperback','9.7888E+12',1192,4.61,372,'Tutte le poesie','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1350995271l/1495678.jpg','b2718',9.49),

Although the first edition was written in 1978, it continues to be a worldwide best-seller. This second edition brings the classic original up to date to include the ANSI standard.  From the Preface:  We have tried to retain the brevity of the first edition. C is not a big language, and it is not well served by a big book. We have improved the exposition of critical features, such as pointers, that are central to C programming. We have refined the original examples, and have added new examples in several chapters. For instance, the treatment of complicated declarations is augmented by programs that convert declarations into words and vice versa. As before, all examples have been tested directly from the text, which is in machine-readable form.   As we said in the first preface to the first edition, C "wears well as one''s experience with it grows." With a decade more experience, we still feel that way.

Of about 106 speeches, delivered before the Roman people or the Senate if they were political, before jurors if judicial, 58 survive (a few of them incompletely).

    ('Written in 1595, Richard II occupies a significant place in the Shakespeare canon, marking the transition from the earlier history plays dominated by civil war and stark power to a more nuanced representation of the political conflicts of England''s past where character and politics are inextricably intertwined. It is the first of four connected plays--including 1 Henry IV, 2 Henry IV, and Henry V--generally considered Shakespeare''s finest history plays.  The drama of Richard II centers on the power struggle between the grandiloquent King Richard and the plain-spoken, blunt Henry Bolingbroke, who is banished from Britain at the beginning of the play. But when Henry''s father John of Gaunt dies, Richard confiscates his property with no regard to his son''s rights, and Bolingbroke returns to confront the king, who surrenders his crown and is imprisoned in Pomfret Castle, where he is soon murdered. This new edition in the acclaimed Oxford Shakespeare series features a freshly edited version of the text. The wide-ranging introduction describes the play''s historical circumstances, both the period that it dramatizes (the start of the "wars of the roses") and the period in which it was written (late Elizabethan England), and the play''s political significance in its own time and our own. It also focuses on the play''s richly poetic language and its success over the centuries as a play for the stage. Extensive explanatory notes help readers at all levels understand and appreciate the language, characters, and dramatic action and the book''s lively illustrations provide a sense of the historical background and performance of the play.About the Series: For over 100 years Oxford World''s Classics has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

    ('Librarian''s note: An alternate cover edition can be found herePresented here in a new translation, with a historical introduction by the translators, "Fear and Trembling and Repetition" are the most poetic and personal of Soren Kierkegaard''s pseudonymous writings. Published in 1843 and written under the names Johannes de Silentio and Constantine Constantius, respectively, the books demonstrate Kierkegaard''s transmutation of the personal into the lyrically religious.Each work uses as a point of departure Kierkegaard''s breaking of his engagement to Regine Olsen--his sacrifice of "that single individual." From this beginning "Fear and Trembling" becomes an exploration of the faith that transcends the ethical, as in Abraham''s willingness to sacrifice his son Isaac at God''s command. This faith, which persists in the face of the absurd, is rewarded finally by the return of all that the faithful one is willing to sacrifice. "Repetition" discusses the most profound implications of unity of personhood and of identity within change, beginning with the ironic story of a young poet who cannot fulfill the ethical claims of his engagement because of the possible consequences of his marriage. The poet finally despairs of repetition (renewal) in the ethical sphere, as does his advisor and friend Constantius in the aesthetic sphere. The book ends with Constantius'' intimation of a third kind of repetition--in the religious sphere.','Kierkegaard''s Writings #6','Paperback','9.78069E+12',420,4.22,4456,'Fear and Trembling/Repetition','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1223649279l/24968.jpg','b2768',15.6),

He''s just landed a comic book deal that might finally enable him to support his family by making art instead of teaching it.

In the 1920s and since, it has also given white readers a startling new perspective on their own culture, revealing to many the double standard of racial identity imposed on black Americans.Narrated by a mulatto man whose light skin allows him to "pass" for white, the novel describes a pilgrimage through America''s color lines at the turn of the century--from a black college in Jacksonville to an elite New York nightclub, from the rural South to the white suburbs of the Northeast.This is a powerful, unsentimental examination of race in America, a hymn to the anguish of forging an identity in a nation obsessed with color.

As Sapolsky explains, most of us do not lie awake at night worrying about whether we have leprosy or malaria. Instead, the diseases we fear-and the ones that plague us now-are illnesses brought on by the slow accumulation of damage, such as heart disease and cancer. When we worry or experience stress, our body turns on the same physiological responses that an animal''s does, but we do not resolve conflict in the same way-through fighting or fleeing. Over time, this activation of a stress response makes us literally sick. 	Combining cutting-edge research with a healthy dose of good humor and practical advice, Why Zebras Don''t Get Ulcers explains how prolonged stress causes or intensifies a range of physical and mental afflictions, including depression, ulcers, colitis, heart disease, and more.

She reveals Miyazaki to be not just a master of the art of animation, but a meticulous craftsman who sees his work as a medium for shaping the humanistic and environmental concerns of our times.An overview of the artist and his early career is followed by in-depth examinations of seven major Miyazaki films: Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind, Laputa: Castle in the Sky, Castle of Cagliostro, My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki''s Delivery Service, Porco Rosso, and Princess Mononoke. Included are design and technical data, story synopses and character sketches, personnel and filmography data, and critical evaluation.

Da Flannery O''Connor a Henry James, da Cechov a Tolstoj, non c''è un autore di racconti al quale Alice Munro non sia stata paragonata. Ma la sua capacità di dipanare in un lampo l''irriducibile complessità della natura umana è incomparabile. Questi racconti possiedono la straordinaria capacità di trascinare il lettore nei meandri di una memoria che non è la sua per risvegliare emozioni che sono di tutti.

Todos os textos têm como tema central a questão do poder nas sociedades capitalistas - a sua natureza, seu exercício em instituições, sua relação com a produção da verdade e as resistências que suscita. O método genealógico desenvolvido por Foucault evidencia a existência de formas de exercício do poder diferentes do Estado, a ele articuladas e indispensáveis à sua sustentação e atuação eficaz.

    ('Originally published in 1971, The Exorcist is now a major television series on FOX. It remains one of the most controversial novels ever written and went on to become a literary phenomenon: It spent fifty-seven weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, seventeen consecutively at number one. Inspired by a true story of a child’s demonic possession in the 1940s, William Peter Blatty created an iconic novel that focuses on Regan, the eleven-year-old daughter of a movie actress residing in Washington, D.C. A small group of overwhelmed yet determined individuals must rescue Regan from her unspeakable fate, and the drama that ensues is gripping and unfailingly terrifying.Two years after its publication, The Exorcist was, of course, turned into a wildly popular motion picture, garnering ten Academy Award nominations. On opening day of the film, lines of the novel’s fans stretched around city blocks. In Chicago, frustrated moviegoers used a battering ram to gain entry through the double side doors of a theater. In Kansas City, police used tear gas to disperse an impatient crowd who tried to force their way into a cinema. The three major television networks carried footage of these events; CBS’s Walter Cronkite devoted almost ten minutes to the story. The Exorcist was, and is, more than just a novel and a film: it is a true landmark.Purposefully raw and profane, The Exorcist still has the extraordinary ability to disturb readers and cause them to forget that it is “just a story.” Published here in this beautiful fortieth anniversary edition, it remains an unforgettable reading experience and will continue to shock and frighten a new generation of readers.','40th Anniversary Edition','Paperback','9.78006E+12',400,4.15,150049,'The Exorcist','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1407112440l/10717333.jpg','b2825',14.84),

    ('This is the third volume of the History of Middle-earth, which comprises here-tofore unpublished manuscripts that were written over a period of many years before Tolkien''s Simlarillion was published. Volumes 1 and 2 were the Book of Lost Tales, Part One and The Book of Lost Tales, Part Two. Together, these volumes encompass an extraordinarily extensive body of material ornamenting and buttressing what must be the most fully realized world ever to spring from a single author''s imagination."I write alliterative verse with pleasure," wrote J.R.R. Tolkien in 1955, "though I have published little beyond the fragments in The Lord of the Rings, except The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth." The first of the poems in The Lays of Beleriand is the previously unpublished Lay of the Children of Hurin, his early but most sustained work in the ancient English meter, intended to narrate on a grand scale the tragedy of Turin Turambar. It was account of the killing by Turin of his friend Beleg, as well as a unique description of the great redoubt of Nargothrond. The Lay of the Children of Hurin was supplanted by the Lay of Leithian, "Release from Bondage", in which another major legend of the Elder Days received poetic form, in this case in rhyme. The chief source of the short prose tale of Beren and Luthien is The Silmarillion. This, too, was not completed, but the whole Quest of the Silmaril is told, and the poem breaks off only after the encounter with Morgoth in his subterranean fortress. Many years later, when The Lord of the rings was finished, J.R.R. Tolkien returned to the Lay of Leithian and started on a new version, which is also given in this book.Accompanying the poems are commentaries on the evolution of the history of the Elder Days, which was much developed during the years of the composition of the two Lays. Also included is the notable criticism in detail of the Lay of Lethian by C.S. Lewis, Tolkien''s friend and colleague, who read the poem in 1929. By assuming that this poem is actually a fragment from a past lost in history, Lewis underlined the remarkable power of its author''s imaginative talents and academic competence.','First US Edition','Hardcover','9.7804E+12',393,3.96,3004,'The Lays of Beleriand','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1374681487l/77678.jpg','b2827',23.14),

But he is then presented with a mysterious legacy that obliges him to reconsider a variety of things he thought he’d understood all along, and to revise his estimation of his own nature and place in the world.    A novel so compelling that it begs to be read in a single sitting, with stunning psychological and emotional depth and sophistication, The Sense of an Ending is a brilliant new chapter in Julian Barnes’s oeuvre. --publisher''s description','Borzoi Edition','ebook','9.78031E+12',107,3.71,127506,'The Sense of an Ending','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1325386727l/12237673.jpg','b2830',24.29),
    ('Quasi nulla piace ai lettori di Mordecai Richler quanto addentrarsi nell''albero genealogico di Barney Panofsky, sperando prima o poi di imbattersi nel vero progenitore romanzesco di uno dei personaggi più amati degli ultimi anni. Bene, con questo libro del 1980 la singolare caccia all''uomo iniziata, in Italia, tredici anni fa può considerarsi conclusa. Entra Joshua Shapiro, scrittore e giornalista di successo ricoverato in ospedale dopo la misteriosa sparizione dell’amatissima moglie, e dopo essere stato coinvolto in un clamoroso scandalo di natura sessuale. Nello stato confusionale in cui si trova, Joshua non è in grado di dire quale delle innumerevoli voci che circolano sul suo conto sia fondata, e quale invece debba considerarsi una calunnia. Per riuscirci, dovrà infatti andare molto indietro nel tempo, fino a un''infanzia affidata in parti uguali alla madre, nota nella zona di St. Urbain Street per i suoi spogliarelli, e al padre, un pugile a riposo e furfante in attività, molto ansioso di trasmettere al figlio i segreti del suo (secondo) mestiere. Cominciando dall''inizio – attraverso gli anni, le donne, gli amici, e la solita, incontenibile frenesia vitale – Joshua riuscirà, a modo suo, a comporre il rompicapo. Sarà una ricerca movimentata e molto lunga, per lui: ma per il lettore, come sempre e anche di più, persino troppo breve.','Fabula','Hardcover','9.78885E+12',466,3.9,1085,'Joshua allora e oggi','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1381310319l/18655768.jpg','b2831',42.0),

    ('Like George Orwell and Philip Wylie, Ken Kesey is concerned with man''s battle to be himself in a world of increasing controls, the battle of joy and freedom against a society which fosters guilt and shame. His first novel, One Flew Over the Cuckoo''s Nest, tells the story of a struggle between a man and a woman for the spirits and hearts of a group of people who have been defeated by the world.The setting for these defeated lives is a mental institution. The teller of the story, a half-Indian and a long-time inmate, has made the most complete retreat from life of all of them; he will not talk, and he has fooled the staff into thinking he is deaf and dumb. But through his self-imposed protective fog he is an acute observer. His vision of the life around him seems to have a truth which is beyond the definitions of sanity or insanity. To him the world is run by an all-powerful "Combine." The hear of the war, the "Big Nurse," is the chief instrument of evil. She wields her insidious power over the men to destroy their wills and freeze them into mindless obedience.Into this gray world comes McMurphy, a brawling, gambling man, full of spirit and a glorious lust for life. He is horrified by the docility with which the other men accept the rule of the Big Nurse and decides to fight her on her own terms. The battle begins, for him, as a lark - a way of winning the bets he has made with the men. And then, as he becomes more aware of the terrible dangers in it, and more committed to the others who have come to count on him for their own survival, his decision to go on is a heroic act of sacrifice and compassion.','50th Anniversary Edition','Hardcover','9.78067E+12',277,4.19,543625,'One Flew Over the Cuckoo''s Nest','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1360102214l/12697427.jpg','b2833',49.68),

Maria ha sei anni ed è appena diventata «figlia d’anima» dell’anziana Bonaria Urrai, secondo l’uso campidanese che consente alle famiglie numerose di compensare le sterilità altrui attraverso una adozione sulla parola; il patto tacito è che la figlia acquisirà lo status di erede, ma in cambio promette di prendersi cura della madre adottiva nei bisogni della vecchiaia. La bambina è inizialmente convinta che Bonaria Urrai faccia la sarta, e infatti le giornate sono segnate dallo scorrere nella bottega casalinga di una umanità paesana, fatta di piccole miserie e di relazioni costruite di gesti e di sguardi, molto piú che di parole. Accettata come normale dal paese, l’adozione solidale tra la vecchia e la bambina si consolida malgrado lo sfaldarsi circostante delle antiche certezze. Attraverso lo sguardo privilegiato della bambina che cresce, le contraddizioni tra il vecchio e il nuovo emergono via via piú evidenti: nell’esperienza della scuola dell’obbligo, e in quella del confronto tra la fede cristiana e i retaggi di una religiosità assai piú antica nel tempo.

Eppure, alla vigilia del matrimonio, Pierre decide di infrangere quella invisibile ma solida barriera «fatta di buon sangue, di carni robuste e sane e di risparmi investiti in titoli di Stato, una barriera destinata a proteggere per sempre i giovani dalle insidie della sorte e dalle loro stesse passioni», e la legge non scritta per la quale di generazione in generazione accoppiamenti giudiziosi stringono sempre di più i legami tra le poche famiglie che contano della ricca borghesia di provincia – e sposa la donna che ama.

Un curioso gruppetto, che si trovò, sotto la guida del grande Edward, nella delicata situazione di chi dà all’evoluzione una spinta che non si riequilibrerà mai: la spinta da cui siamo nati tutti noi. Ragionando con impeccabile acume scientifico, nonché un delizioso humour freddo, Edward e i suoi scoprirono «alcune delle cose più potenti e spaventose su cui la razza umana abbia mai messo le mani: il fuoco, la lancia, il matrimonio e così via», sempre sulla base di una elementare esigenza: quella di «cucinare senza essere cucinati e mangiare senza essere mangiati». E naturalmente non mancarono le dispute e i crucci, perché ogni volta si poteva discutere se quelle nuove invenzioni erano davvero buone o cattive, se non rischiavano di sfuggire al controllo e soprattutto se non andavano un po’ troppo contro la natura. Mah...Pubblicato per la prima volta nel 1960, e poi ripreso più volte sotto vari titoli, questo libro si è fatto strada silenziosamente fra i classici della fantascienza a ritroso. Ma in realtà è un libro inclassificabile: una riflessione romanzesca, acutissima e leggera, su tutta la storia dell’umanità, contrassegnata in ogni dettaglio da quella limpidezza e da quell’ironia che appartengono alla migliore tradizione letteraria e scientifica inglese.

    ('Before Madeleine Albright turned twelve, her life was shaken by the Nazi invasion of Czechoslovakia—the country where she was born—the Battle of Britain, the near total destruction of European Jewry, the Allied victory in World War II, the rise of communism, and the onset of the Cold War.Albright''s experiences, and those of her family, provide a lens through which to view the most tumultuous dozen years in modern history. Drawing on her memory, her parents'' written reflections, interviews with contemporaries, and newly available documents, Albright recounts a tale that is by turns harrowing and inspiring. Prague Winter is an exploration of the past with timeless dilemmas in mind and, simultaneously, a journey with universal lessons that is intensely personal.The book takes readers from the Bohemian capital''s thousand-year-old castle to the bomb shelters of London, from the desolate prison ghetto of Terezín to the highest councils of European and American government. Albright reflects on her discovery of her family''s Jewish heritage many decades after the war, on her Czech homeland''s tangled history, and on the stark moral choices faced by her parents and their generation. Often relying on eyewitness descriptions, she tells the story of how millions of ordinary citizens were ripped from familiar surroundings and forced into new roles as exiled leaders and freedom fighters, resistance organizers and collaborators, victims and killers. These events of enormous complexity are never-theless shaped by concepts familiar to any growing child: fear, trust, adaptation, the search for identity, the pressure to conform, the quest for independence, and the difference between right and wrong."No one who lived through the years of 1937 to 1948," Albright writes, "was a stranger to profound sadness. Millions of innocents did not survive, and their deaths must never be forgotten. Today we lack the power to reclaim lost lives, but we have a duty to learn all that we can about what happened and why." At once a deeply personal memoir and an incisive work of history, Prague Winter serves as a guide to the future through the lessons of the past—as seen through the eyes of one of the international community''s most respected and fascinating figures.','First Edition','Hardcover','9.78006E+12',467,3.97,5366,'Prague Winter: A Personal Story of Remembrance and War, 1937-1948','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1331740855l/13096280.jpg','b2927',35.78),

Championed by Gertrude Stein, Simone de Beauvoir, Theodore Roosevelt, and J. K. Rowling, it is however much more than the girls book intended by Alcott s first publisher. In this richly annotated, illustrated edition, Daniel Shealy illuminates the novel s deep engagement with issues such as social equality, reform movements, the Civil War, friendship, love, loss, and of course the passage into adulthood.The editor provides running commentary on biographical contexts (Did Alcott, like Jo, have a mood pillow ?), social and historical contexts (When may a lady properly decline a gentleman s invitation to dance?), literary allusions (Who is Mrs. Malaprop?), and words likely to cause difficulty to modern readers (What is a velvet snood? A pickled lime?). With Shealy as a guide, we appreciate anew the confusions and difficulties that beset the March sisters as they overcome their burdens and journey toward maturity and adulthood: beautiful, domestic-minded Meg, doomed and forever childlike Beth, selfish Amy, and irrepressible Jo.

Le ragazze vestono Onyx, o qualunque sia l''ultima griffe in fatto di body, parlano di Avant, di Marsan e delle mode dell''ultimo minuto. I ragazzi invece girano in moto. Le ragazze si preparano a incontrare il ragazzo della loro vita. I ragazzi si sfidano in prove di resistenza fisica, di velocità, di rischio. Fino all''ultimo respiro. SUllo sfondo di una frenetica vita di clan, di banda (il mitico gruppo dei budokani: Schello, Pollo, Lucone), Step e Babi si incontrano.

Appartengono a due mondi diversi, ma finiscono per innamorarsi. Non è un rapporto semplice perché nessuno dei due cede facilmente. Eppure si trasformano. Babi è irriconoscibile agli occhi dei genitori. Step rivela aspetti che ben poco collimano con la sua immagine, faticosamente costruita, di superduro. E, in effetti, muscoli, palestra e violenza nascondono un trauma, un nodo irrisolto.Tre metri sopra il cielo è un romanzo di vite quotidiane, una commedia romantica, un ritratto moviemntatissimo di adolescenti allo sbando.Pubblicato da un piccolo editore romano, è circolato per anni in fotocopie, diventando un cult fra i giovani della capitale."Il sole sta salendo, è una bella mattinata.

    ('A decade ago, Deepak Chopra, M.D., wrote Perfect Health, the first practical guide to harnessing the healing power of the mind, which became a national bestseller. The book described how breakthroughs in physics and medicine were underscoring the validity of a 5,000-year-old medical system from ancient India known as Ayurveda ("the knowledge of life span" in Sanskrit). Perfect Health went on to describe how to apply the ancient wisdom of Ayurveda to everyday life. In celebration of this classic work we have created this new edition, revised and updated to include the latest medical research.Although we experience our bodies as solid, they are in fact more like fires that are constantly being consumed and renewed. We grow new stomach linings every five days, for instance. Our skin is new every five weeks. Each year, fully 98 percent of the total number of atoms in our bodies is replaced. Ayurveda gives us the tools to intervene at this quantum level, where we are being created anew each day. Ayurveda tells us that freedom from sickness depends on contacting our own awareness, bringing it into balance, and then extending that balance to the body.Perfect Health provides a complete step-by-step program of mind body medicine tailored to individual needs. A quiz identifies the reader''s mind body type: thin, restless Vata; enterprising, efficient Pitta; tranquil, steady Kapha; or any combination of these three. This body type becomes the basis for a specific Ayurvedic program of diet, stress reduction, neuromuscular integration, exercise, and daily routines. The result is a total plan, tailor-made for each individual, to reestablish the body''s essential balance with nature; to strengthen the mind body connection; and to use the power of quantum healing to transcend the ordinary limitations of disease and aging--in short, for achieving Perfect Health.','Revised','Paperback','9.78061E+12',400,4.02,2785,'Perfect Health: The Complete Mind/Body Guide','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348609888l/836511.jpg','b2957',25.08),

    ('At his death in 1976, Raymond Queneau was one of France''s most eminent men of letters – novelist, poet, essayist, editor, scientist, mathematician, and, more to the point, pataphysician. And only a pataphysician nurtured lovingly on surrealist excess could have come up with The Blue Flowers, Queneau''s 1964 novel, now reissued as a New Directions Paperbook. To a pataphysician all things are equal, there is no improvement or progress in the human condition, and a ‘message’ is an invention of the benighted reader, certainly not the author or his perplexing creations – the sweet, fennel-drinking Cidrolin and the rampaging Duke d''Auge. History is mostly what the duke rampages through – 700 years of it at 175-year clips. He refuses to crusade, clobbers his king with the ‘in’ toy of 1439 – the cannon – dabbles in alchemy, and decides that those musty caves down at Altamira need a bit of sprucing up. Meanwhile, Cidrolin in the 1960s lolls on his barge moored along the Seine, sips essence of fennel, and ineffectually tries to catch the graffitist who nightly defiles his fence. But mostly he naps. Is it just a coincidence that the duke appears only when Cidrolin is dozing? And vice versa? In the tradition of Villon and Céline, Queneau attempted to bring the language of the French streets into common literary usage, and his mad word-plays, bad puns, bawdy jokes, and anachronistic wackiness have been kept amazingly and glitteringly intact by the incomparable translator Barbara Wright.','New Directions Paperbook','Paperback','9.78081E+12',232,4.04,1809,'The Blue Flowers','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328003015l/28370.jpg','b2965',10.85),

    ('Anti-intellectualism in American Life was awarded the 1964 Pulitzer Prize in Non-Fiction. It is a book which throws light on many features of the American character. Its concern is not merely to portray the scorners of intellect in American life, but to say something about what the intellectual is, and can be, as a force in a democratic society.Hofstadter set out to trace the social movements that altered the role of intellect in American society from a virtue to a vice. In so doing, he explored questions regarding the purpose of education and whether the democratization of education altered that purpose and reshaped its form.In considering the historic tension between access to education and excellence in education, Hofstadter argued that both anti-intellectualism and utilitarianism were consequences, in part, of the democratization of knowledge.Moreover, he saw these themes as historically embedded in America''s national fabric, an outcome of her colonial European and evangelical Protestant heritage. Anti-intellectualism and utilitarianism were functions of American cultural heritage, not necessarily of democracy.','First Vintage Book paperback','Paperback','9.78039E+12',434,4.17,2084,'Anti-Intellectualism in American Life','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327787785l/582067.jpg','b2973',21.18),
    ('From a helicopter high above the empty California desert, a man is sent free-falling into the night…. In Chicago, a woman learns that an elite team of ex–army investigators is being hunted down one by one.... And on the streets of Portland, Jack Reacher—soldier, cop, hero—is pulled out of his wandering life by a code that few other people could understand. From the first shocking scenes in Lee Child’s explosive new novel, Jack Reacher is plunged like a knife into the heart of a conspiracy that is killing old friends…and is on its way to something even worse.A decade postmilitary, Reacher has an ATM card and the clothes on his back—no phone, no ties, and no address. But now a woman from his old unit has done the impossible. From Chicago, Frances Neagley finds Reacher, using a signal only the eight members of their elite team of army investigators would know. She tells him a terrifying story—about the brutal death of a man they both served with. Soon Reacher is reuniting with the survivors of his old team, scrambling to raise the living, bury the dead, and connect the dots in a mystery that is growing darker by the day. The deeper they dig, the more they don’ t know: about two other comrades who have suddenly gone missing—and a trail that leads into the neon of Vegas and the darkness of international terrorism.For now, Reacher can only react. To every sound. Every suspicion. Every scent and every moment. Then Reacher will trust the people he once trusted with his life—and take this thing all the way to the end. Because in a world of bad luck and trouble, when someone targets Jack Reacher and his team, they’d better be ready for what comes right back at them…','Delacorte','Hardcover','9.78039E+12',378,4.18,56704,'Bad Luck and Trouble','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1441133915l/108942.jpg','b2974',20.04),

Su autor, Chaves Nogales, había conocido a Belmonte poco tiempo antes de la publicación del libro y aunque no era aficionado a los toros congeniaron enseguida.

    ('"No man ever did more to alter and correct the map of the Earth," writes Percy Adams in his new Introduction, than James Cook, the Scotland-born British naval commander who rose from humble beginnings to pilot three great eighteenth-century voyages of discovery in the then practically uncharted Pacific. His explorations of the eastern coastline of Australia, leading to its eventual British colonization; his thorough charting of New Zealand, discovery of the Hawaiian Island, and his investigation of both the mythical ''Terra Incognita'' in the southern ocean and the equally mythical Northwest Passage, as well as his contributions to cartography and to the cure and prevention of sea disease were all of immense scientific and political significance. Though lacking in formal education, Cook was a man of great intelligence and unbounded curiosity, and his journals reflect a wide-ranging interest in everything from island customs to specific problems of navigation, charting, command, and diplomacy.This reprinting of selections from Cook''s journals, edited by A. Grenfell Price, celebrates the bicentennial anniversary of his explorations. It abounds in descriptions of newly discovered plant species, particulars of coastline and land features, details of navigation, and impressions of the various Pacific peoples he encountered. Cook''s was a many-faceted genius, able at once to grasp the complexities of mathematics necessary for navigation and mapping and the subtle intricacies of politics and negotiation. He often recorded his keen judgments of both subordinates and native chieftains and priests in a way that displays his own great spirit and humanity. Always solicitous of the health of his crewmen, he took great pains to insure proper diet and conditions of cleanliness, and he carefully described these measures in his journal. His tragic death at the hands of Hawaiian islanders is fully rendered from eyewitness accounts, and the implications of his discoveries to the expansion of scientific knowledge are clearly presented by the editor.Although Cook''s journals will prove of inestimable value to historians, anthropologists, and students of the history of science, they can be enjoyed equally as lively narratives of high adventure and discovery. Any sympathetically roving imagination will take unbounded delight in this great classic of exploration by a most "curious and restless son of Earth."','Abridged','Paperback','9.78014E+12',657,3.89,667,'The Journals','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1413749131l/422755.jpg','b2999',42.54),

Partire alla volta di un mondo nuovo abbandonando la propria vita è difficile, anche se quel mondo ha i tratti di un paradiso, ma per Ifemelu è necessario. Il suo paese è asfittico, l''università in sciopero. E poi, in fondo, sa che ad accoglierla troverà zia Uju e che Obinze, il suo ragazzo dai tempi del liceo, presto la raggiungerà. Arrivata in America, Ifemelu deve imparare un''altra volta a parlare e comportarsi. Diverso è l''accento, ma anche il significato delle parole. Ciò che era normale viene guardato con sospetto. Ciò che era un lusso viene dato per scontato. La nuova realtà, inclemente e fatta di conti da pagare, impone scelte estreme. La frattura con il passato, compresi gli affetti più cari, è inevitabile. A complicare tutto c''è la questione della pelle. Ifemelu non aveva mai saputo di essere nera: lo scopre negli Stati Uniti, dove la società sembra stratificata in base al colore. L''ostilità verso l''Altro ha tanti modi di esprimersi e passa anche attraverso cose apparentemente futili, come l''imperare di canoni specifici per l''acconciatura. Se le treccine sono bollate come poco professionali, l''afro va domato a litri di lisciante. Esasperata, Ifemelu decide di dare voce al proprio scontento dalle pagine di un blog. I suoi post, acuti e scevri di vittimismo, si conquistano velocemente un folto pubblico di lettori, che cresce e cresce fino ad aprire a Ifemelu imprevisti e fortunati sbocchi sul piano professionale e privato. Ma tra le pieghe del successo e di una relazione con tutte le carte in regola si fa strada un''insoddisfazione strisciante. Ifemelu si sente estranea alla sua stessa vita e, lì dov''è, non riesce ad affondare le radici, pur sapendo che in Nigeria le esperienze accumulate e il nuovo modo di guardare il mondo le guadagnerebbero l''epiteto spregiativo di «Americanah». Eppure il suo paese le manca, e le manca Obinze, ormai sposato e con una figlia. Ancora una volta, con coraggio, riempie la valigia e si prepara a un salto nel buio.','Supercoralli','Hardcover','9.78881E+12',466,4.29,175308,'Americanah','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1411741498l/23273450.jpg','b3001',17.86),

    ('Laura is happily married, a mother, and a successful novelist. Although prey to night terrors, she is adept at smoothing the disorder of reality into controlled prose. Interweaving memory, conversation, and reflection, Walking Naked telescopes the whole of Laura''s life—childhood, marriages, triumphs, and disappointments—into a day in which the past and the present converge. It begins with a game of tennis played for duty rather than amusement and progresses, via an afternoon party of old friends and jaded emotions, to a bewildering visit to Laura''s son, who is imprisoned on a drugs charge. At its close, the possibility of death within the family brings unresolved conflicts to center stage, and Laura strips herself of the posturing and self-deceit with which she has cloaked her vulnerability. Continually surprising, witty, and often disquieting, this is one of Nina Bawden''s most impressive novels.','Virago Modern Classics','Paperback','9.78185E+12',221,3.93,29,'Walking Naked','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1267970241l/3381690.jpg','b3003',30.03),

Al cuore della sua "filosofia" ci sono l''unicità e il potenziale di ciascun individuo, uniti però alla sua capacità di ascoltare gli altri e improvvisare insieme a loro. È stato creato dai discendenti degli schiavi, ma sa parlare di libertà. È figlio della malinconia del blues, ma sa lasciarsi andare alla felicità più pura.

    ('“THAT’S NO MOON.”–Obi-Wan KenobiThe Death Star’s name says it all, with bone-chilling accuracy. It is a virtual world unto itself–equipped with uncanny power for a singularly brutal purpose: to obliterate entire planets in the blink of an eye. Its annihilation of the planet Alderaan, at the merciless command of Grand Moff Tarkin, lives in infamy. And its own ultimate destruction, at the hands of Luke Skywalker, is the stuff of legend. But what is the whole story, and who are the players, behind the creation of this world-killing satellite of doom?The near extermination of the Jedi order cleared the way for Palpatine–power-hungry Senator and Sith Lord–to seize control of the Republic, declare himself Emperor, and usher in a fearsome, totalitarian regime. But even with the dreaded Darth Vader enforcing Palpatine’s sinister will, the threat of rebellion still looms. And the Emperor knows that only abject fear–and the ability to punish dissent with devastating consequences–can ensure his unchallenged control of the galaxy. Enter ambitious and ruthless government official Wilhuff Tarkin, architect of the Emperor’s terrifying dream come true. From inception to completion, construction of the unprecedented Death Star is awash in the intrigues, hidden agendas, unexpected revelations, and daring gambits of those involved on every level. The brightest minds and boldest egos, the most ambitious and corrupt, the desperate and the devious, all have a stake in the Death Star–and its potential to control the fate of the galaxy.Soldiers and slaves, loyalists and Rebels, spies and avengers, the innocent and the evil–all their paths and fates will cross and intertwine as the Death Star moves from its maiden voyage to its final showdown. And a shadowy chapter of Star Wars history is stunningly illuminated in a thrilling, unforgettable adventure.','First Edition','Hardcover','9.78035E+12',363,3.83,3459,'Death Star','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320503718l/786729.jpg','b3009',35.97),

It is a focus never more needed than in this age of confusing economic headlines.In a bold new concluding chapter entitled “The End of the Worldly Philosophy?” Heilbroner reminds us that the word “end” refers to both the purpose and limits of economics.

    ('A tender, moving tale of unconditional love in a family that, despite its profound flaws, gave the author the fiery determination to carve out a successful life on her own terms.Jeannette Walls grew up with parents whose ideals and stubborn nonconformity were both their curse and their salvation. Rex and Rose Mary Walls had four children. In the beginning, they lived like nomads, moving among Southwest desert towns, camping in the mountains. Rex was a charismatic, brilliant man who, when sober, captured his children''s imagination, teaching them physics, geology, and above all, how to embrace life fearlessly. Rose Mary, who painted and wrote and couldn''t stand the responsibility of providing for her family, called herself an "excitement addict." Cooking a meal that would be consumed in fifteen minutes had no appeal when she could make a painting that might last forever. Later, when the money ran out, or the romance of the wandering life faded, the Walls retreated to the dismal West Virginia mining town -- and the family -- Rex Walls had done everything he could to escape. He drank. He stole the grocery money and disappeared for days. As the dysfunction of the family escalated, Jeannette and her brother and sisters had to fend for themselves, supporting one another as they weathered their parents'' betrayals and, finally, found the resources and will to leave home. What is so astonishing about Jeannette Walls is not just that she had the guts and tenacity and intelligence to get out, but that she describes her parents with such deep affection and generosity. Hers is a story of triumph against all odds, but also a tender, moving tale of unconditional love in a family that despite its profound flaws gave her the fiery determination to carve out a successful life on her own terms.

Asistind neputincios la martiriul acestora, Rodrigues isi vede propria credinta pusa la incercare si incepe sa se indoiasca de un Dumnezeu care raspunde la suferintele credinciosilor sai doar printr-o tacere indiferenta. Vindut la rindul lui autoritatilor, supus la torturi cumplite si silit sa se dezica de credinta sa, Rodrigues are constiinta dureroasa a esecului, dar si revelatia faptului ca Dumnezeu este prezent intotdeauna, chiar si in tacere.„O opera remarcabila: sumbra, delicata si uluitor de empatica.” (John Updike)„Tacere este o capodopera, o drama lucida si eleganta.” (The New York Times Review of Books)„Cel mai bun roman al lui Endo...

    ('Di tutti i libri di Bolaño, La letteratura nazista in America è certo il più intensamente, smodatamente, spudoratamente borgesiano – e anche wilcockiano, se si pensa alla Sinagoga degli iconoclasti. E insieme rappresenta, se così si può dire, la quintessenza della «bolañità». In apparenza, l''oggetto è sobrio e rassicurante: un panorama degli scrittori filonazisti, di ognuno dei quali si traccia il percorso biografico e si dà conto della produzione; si descrivono perfino alcune opere, nonché i rapporti intercorsi fra di loro, le riviste che li hanno ospitati, le case editrici che li hanno pubblicati, e alla fine del volume figurano un indice dei nomi e una bibliografia. Eppure, quasi subito, ci accorgiamo che qualcosa non funziona: non foss''altro perché almeno un paio risultano morti dopo il 2015. A poco a poco capiamo, in una sorta di vertigine, che nessuno di questi scrittori, poetesse, movimenti letterari, è mai esistito, e che Bolaño sta costruendo sotto i nostri occhi un inquietante universo parallelo: del tutto plausibile e del tutto immaginario.

    ('The various kinds and conditions of love are a common theme for Kierkegaard, beginning with his early Either/Or, through "The Diary of the Seducer" and Judge William''s eulogy on married love, to his last work, on the changelessness of God''s love. Works of Love, the midpoint in the series, is also the monumental high point, because of its penetrating, illuminating analysis of the forms and sources of love. Love as feeling and mood is distinguished from works of love, love of the lovable from love of the unlovely, preferential love from love as the royal law, love as mutual egotism from triangular love, and erotic love from self-giving love.This work is marked by Kierkegaard''s Socratic awareness of the reader, both as the center of awakened understanding and as the initiator of action. Written to be read aloud, the book conveys a keenness of thought and an insightful, poetic imagination that make such an attentive approach richly rewarding. Works of Love not only serves as an excellent place to begin exploring the writings of Kierkegaard, but also rewards many rereadings.','Kierkegaard''s Writings #16','Paperback','9.78069E+12',576,4.36,1406,'Works of Love','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388373530l/83324.jpg','b3067',17.86),

    ('Quando questo libro apparve, nel 1960, suonò come una voce appartata, subito coperta dal chiasso delle cose in baldanzoso movimento; oggi quello stesso movimento delle cose lo ha suffragato, a distanza di tempo, in modo allarmante. Ma Cioran non va misurato su alcuna attualità che non sia quella, perenne, di una caduta originaria, la «caduta nel tempo». Come leggiamo in questo libro, «una volta cacciato dal paradiso, l’uomo, perché non ci pensasse più e non ne soffrisse, ottenne in compenso la facoltà di volere, di tendere all’atto, di inabissarvisi con entusiasmo, con brio». Di quell’accecato entusiasmo, di quel sinistro brio è fatto ciò che da qualche secolo chiamiamo storia. All’interno di essa agiscono certe forze immense che non solo gli storici, ma i pudibondi psicologi dimenticano sempre più spesso di nominare. Cioran sa osservarle con la maestria di un moralista di Versailles che si sia educato su Dostoevskij e sulle taglienti discriminazioni dei testi buddhisti: la «nostalgia della servitù» e l’«euforia della dannazione», il «delirio dei miserabili» e le «virtù esplosive dell’umiliazione», altrettante tappe di un grande viaggio che qui viene definito «l’odissea del rancore». Ma c’è qualcosa di ancora più disperante della storia: la pretesa di uscirne con i mezzi forgiati dalla storia stessa, l’utopia. Se dissipiamo la loro cornice di Buone Intenzioni, le utopie sono inferni rosati, che non esercitano più neppure l’attrazione dell’orrido. E il loro difetto non è nella lontananza dalla realtà, ma nella capacità di anticiparci con notevole precisione un futuro di squallore. «I due generi, l’utopistico e l’apocalittico, che ci sembrano così dissimili, si fondono, stingono adesso l’uno nell’altro per formarne un terzo, meravigliosamente adatto a rispecchiare la sorta di realtà che ci minaccia e alla quale diremo tuttavia di sì, un sì corretto e senza illusioni.

    ('First Person Queer, an anthology of nonfiction essays written in the first person by a variety of gay and lesbian authors, was a snapshot of GLBT life and experience in the modern age. Published in 2007, it received wide acclaim and won the Lambda Literary Award for Anthologies and the Independent Publisher Award (Gold) for gay/lesbian books. Second Person Queer is an unusual companion book: it is an anthology of essays on GLBT life written in the second person. The essays take the form of letters to family and friends, missives to homophobes, confessions to lovers, and words of advice for the next generation; they deal with subjects as large and looming as violence, coming out, gay marriage, and raising children. They are as intimate and engaging as How to Become a Visible Femme, How Not to Be Offended by Everything, and How to Become a Country Leather Bear. Powerful, funny, poignant: these are the stories of who you are as a GLBT person, or the person you would most like to be. Contributors include S. Bear Bergman, Sky Gilbert, Matt Bernstein Sycamore (a.k.a. Mattilda), Achy Obejas, Andy Quan, Michael Rowe, Stacey May Fowles, and Amber Dawn.  Co-editors Richard Labonté and Lawrence Schimel have written or edited over one hundred books between them; Labonté edits the annual Best Gay Erotica anthologies from Cleis Press, and Schimel’s books include PoMoSexuals and The Mammoth Book of Gay Erotica.','1st Edition','Paperback','9.78155E+12',224,3.74,43,'Second Person Queer: Who You Are (So Far)','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328760855l/5083093.jpg','b3115',20.51),

Decades later the bond remains powerful, but so much else has changed. In The Interestings, Wolitzer follows these characters from the height of youth through middle age, as their talents, fortunes, and degrees of satisfaction diverge.

His current life and name were given to him by his recently retired boss, Hutte, who welcomed him, a onetime client, into his detective agency. Guy makes full use of Hutte''s files – directories, yearbooks, and papers of all kinds going back half a century – but his leads are few.

    ('Undoubtedly the most famous of all of Shakespeare''s plays, Hamlet remains one of the most enduring but also enigmatic pieces of western literature. The story of Hamlet, the young Prince of Denmark, his tortured relationship with his mother, and his quest to avenge his father''s murder at the hand of his brother Claudius has fascinated writers and audiences ever since it was written around 1600.  For many years interest focused on both Hamlet''s inability to avenge his father''s death, claiming that "the native hue of resolution / Is sicklied o''er with the pale cast of thought", and, according to none other than Freud, his oedipal fixation with his mother. However, more recently critics have turned their attention to Hamlet''s bold theatrical self-reflexivity (most famously reflected in the performance of "The Mousetrap"), its fascination with issues of theology and Renaissance humanism, and its dense, complex poetic language. What is so remarkable about the play is the way in which it tends to uncannily reflect the concerns of different epochs. As a result, Hamlet has been at different moments defined as a romantic rebel, an angst-ridden existentialist, a paralysed intellectual and an ambivalent New Man. Whatever subsequent generations make of Hamlet, they are unlikely to exhaust the possibilities of this most extraordinary play. --Jerry Brotton','Penguin Popular Classics','Paperback','9.78014E+12',156,4.01,629253,'Hamlet','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1366931642l/861453.jpg','b3141',45.09),

    ('Since it appeared in 1971, John Rawls''s A Theory of Justice has become a classic. The author has now revised the original edition to clear up a number of difficulties he and others have found in the original book.Rawls aims to express an essential part of the common core of the democratic tradition - justice as fairness - and to provide an alternative to utilitarianism, which had dominated the Anglo-Saxon tradition of political thought since the nineteenth century. Rawls substitutes the ideal of the social contract as a more satisfactory account of the basic rights and liberties of citizens as free and equal persons. "Each person," writes Rawls, "possesses an inviolability founded on justice that even the welfare of society as a whole cannot override."

    ('Un libro sui giovani, perché i giovani, anche se non sempre lo sanno, stanno male. E non per le solite crisi esistenziali che costellano la giovinezza, ma perché un ospite inquietante, il nichilismo, si aggira tra loro, penetra nei loro sentimenti, confonde i loro pensieri, cancella prospettive e orizzonti, fiacca la loro anima, intristisce le passioni rendendole esangui. Le famiglie si allarmano, la scuola non sa più cosa fare. Solo il mercato si interessa di loro per condurli sulle vie del divertimento e del consumo, dove ciò che si consuma è la loro stessa vita, che più non riesce a proiettarsi in un futuro capace di far intravedere una qualche promessa. Va da sé che, se il disagio non è del singolo individuo, l''origine non è psicologica ma culturale. Perciò inefficaci appaiono i rimedi elaborati dalla nostra cultura, sia nella versione religiosa perché Dio è davvero morto, sia nella versione illuminista perché non sembra che la ragione sia oggi il regolatore dei rapporti tra gli uomini. Resta solo la ''ragione strumentale'' che garantisce il progresso tecnico, ma non un ampliamento dell''orizzonte di senso per la latitanza del pensiero e l''aridità del sentimento. C''è una via d''uscita? Si può mettere alla porta l''ospite inquietante? Sì, se sapremo insegnare ai giovani l''''arte del vivere'', come dicevano i Greci, che consiste nel riconoscere le proprie capacità e nell''esplicitarle e vederle fiorire secondo misura.

    ('“Docemente, ao voltar para casa, comecei a recompor o rosto febril de monsieur Reynaud ao mesmo tempo que meditava sobre o soluço do desconhecido monsieur Vallejo. Imagem recorrente, refleti; nos últimos meses era difícil para mim não associar a doença e até a beleza à lembrança de monsieur Reynaud. Era quase meia-noite e eu havia passado o resto da noitada num café do bairro de Passy em companhia de um velho conhecido, alfaiate aposentado que consagrava grande parte do seu tempo ao estudo do mesmerismo. Já não chovia. De alguma maneira, pensei, as pessoas que nos servem de ponte até os pacientes revelam o estado mais profundo destes. Os intermediários como radiografias.”Franz Mesmer, um médico do século XVIII, desenvolveu um método de tratamento de doenças humanas servindo-se do magnetismo animal - uma técnica precursora da hipnose que ficou mais conhecida pelo conto Revelação mesmérica, de Edgar Allan Poe. Um dos discípulos do mesmerismo, Pierre Pain, é o protagonista deste romance de Roberto Bolaño, escrito no início dos anos 1980. Na Paris do entreguerras, Pain é contratado por madame Reynaud para ajudar um sul-americano chamado Vallejo, que sofre de um soluço incurável. Outros médicos avaliaram o homem e nada descobriram. No entanto, logo o protagonista se encontra envolvido em uma conspiração muito maior do que imaginava. Perseguido por dois homens misteriosos que ele julga serem espanhóis, o mesmerista embarca em uma viagem alucinante pelas ruas de Paris, deparando com artistas de vanguarda, filmes raros de ficção científica e complexos labirintos dignos da imaginação de Jorge Luis Borges.Monsieur Pain, um dos primeiros romances escritos por Bolaño, é uma peça rara em sua obra: um livro atmosférico, repleto de temas caros à literatura de gênero, como o ocultismo, a busca detetivesca e a confusão entre sonho e realidade. Enquanto Pain se deixa levar pelo mistério, as fronteiras entre o que é real e o que é imaginação se dissolvem.A revelação final, óbvia para os leitores familiarizados com poesia latino-americana, de que o paciente com soluço se trata do famoso poeta peruano César Vallejo, adiciona ainda mais camadas interpretativas a esta estranha história. As circunstâncias da morte de Vallejo, por sinal, continuam enigmáticas até hoje. Por fim, o epílogo adianta uma técnica narrativa que seria depois consagrada por Bolaño: muitas vozes buscando documentar a vida de pessoas, algumas reais, outras fictícias.','Narrativas hispánicas #275','Paperback','9.78843E+12',176,3.36,2201,'Monsieur Pain','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328203761l/407040.jpg','b3187',6.05),

"In Broad Daylight" tells the story of the killing of Ken Rex McElroy on the main street of Skidmore, Missouri in July 1981. McElroy, an illiterate hog farmer, had terrorized all of northwest Missouri for over 20 years, until the town, and even law enforcement, was terrified of him. McElroy was shot as he sat in his truck in front of the tavern. Over 45 men witnessed the shooting. Despite two eyewitness accounts and three grand jury investigations, no one has been prosecuted for the crime. "In Broad Daylight" won an Edgar Award for Best True Crime. It was also made into a movie starring Brian Denehey, Cloris Leachman and Chris Cooper. It was re-released as an e-book on Amazon July 2012 on the 31st anniversary of the killing. St. Martin''s Press published the last print edition in 2006.In "The Story Behind ''In Broad Daylight,''" MacLean tells how he researched and wrote the book. He tells of guns being drawn on him, being bitten by a dog, and a confrontation with the killer on the killer''s ranch. In addition to updates on characters from the book (including who is still alive and who has died), the book answers many questions about the killing itself, such as who was involved, and what has become of them. MacLean describes the breakthrough events when key characters agreed to speak with him, and he realized he would finally get the story. The author also discusses the nature of the moral consequences of the killing for the town and those involved in the crime. The mini-book contains never-before published photographs of some of the principal characters, including the killer.

    ('Henry James is one of the giants of American literary history. From the novella "Daisy Miller" and classic short stories such as "The Turn of the Screw" to the popular short novel Washington Square and intricately woven and highly complex later novels such as The Golden Bowl and The Ambassadors, James''s work is a required stop on any journey through our nation''s artistic and cultural heritage.  An undisputed masterpiece, The Portrait of a Lady is arguably James''s most popular work, and certainly the finest of his early novels. It focuses on Isabel Archer, a young, intelligent, and spirited American girl, determined to relish her first experience of Europe. She rejects two eligible suitors in her fervent commitment to liberty and independence, declaring that she will never marry. Thanks to the generosity of her devoted cousin Ralph, she is free to make her own choice about her destiny. Yet in the intoxicating worlds of Paris, Florence, and Rome, her fond illusions of self-reliance are twisted by the machinations of her friends and apparent allies. What had seemed to be a vista of infinite promise steadily closes around her and becomes instead a "house of suffocation."Portrait of a Lady is at once a dramatic Victorian tale of betrayal and a wholly modern psychological study of a woman caught in a web of relations she only comes to understand too late. This new edition includes helpful notes on the numerous changes James made between the first edition and the revised New York Edition, reproduced here, an up-to-date bibliography, and a new chronology.About the Series:  For over 100 years Oxford World''s Classics has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

The book remains canonical today because the debate is still very alive.Rothbard opens with a theoretical treatment of business cycle theory, showing how an expansive monetary policy generates imbalances between investment and consumption. He proceeds to examine the Fed''s policies of the 1920s, demonstrating that it was quite inflationary even if the effects did not show up in the price of goods and services. He showed that the stock market correction was merely one symptom of the investment boom that led inevitably to a bust.The Great Depression was not a crisis for capitalism but merely an example of the downturn part of the business cycle, which in turn was generated by government intervention in the economy. Had the book appeared in the 1940s, it might have spared the world much grief.

    ('The classic analysis of how particular political and cultural ideas come to dominate society.The publication of For Marx and Reading Capital established Louis Althusser as one of the most controversial figures in the Western Marxist tradition, and one of the most influential renewals of Marxist thought. Collected here are Althusser’s most significant philosophical writings from the late sixties and through the seventies. Intended to contribute, in his own words, to a ‘left-wing critique of Stalinism that would help put some substance back into the revolutionary project here in the West’, they are the record of a shared history. At the same time they chart Althusser’s critique of the theoretical system unveiled in his own major works, and his developing practice of philosophy as a ‘revolutionary weapon’.The collection opens with two lucid early articles - "Theory, Theoretical Practice and Theoretical Formation" and "On Theoretical Work." The title piece - Althusser’s celebrated lectures in the "Philosophy Course for Scientists" — is the fullest exploration of his new definition of philosophy as politics in the realm of theory, a conception which is further developed in "Lenin and Philosophy." "Is it Simple to be a Marxist in Philosophy?" provides an invaluable account of Althusser’s intellectual development. The volume concludes with two little-known late pieces - "The Transformation of Philosophy," in which the paradoxical history of Marxist philosopher is investigated; and "Marxism today," a sober balance-sheet of the Marxist tradition. Attesting to the unique place that Althusser has occupied in modern intellectual history - between a tradition of Marxism that he sought to reconstruct, and a "post-Marxism" that has eclipsed its predecessor - these texts are indispensable reading.','Verso Radical Thinkers','Paperback','9.78184E+12',179,4.02,409,'On Ideology','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1373999933l/1450671.jpg','b3230',41.08),
    ('Before Joseph Campbell became the world''s most famous practitioner of comparative mythology, there was Sir James George Frazer. The Golden Bough was originally published in two volumes in 1890, but Frazer became so enamored of his topic that over the next few decades he expanded the work sixfold, then in 1922 cut it all down to a single thick edition suitable for mass distribution. The thesis on the origins of magic and religion that it elaborates "will be long and laborious," Frazer warns readers, "but may possess something of the charm of a voyage of discovery, in which we shall visit many strange lands, with strange foreign peoples, and still stranger customs." Chief among those customs--at least as the book is remembered in the popular imagination--is the sacrificial killing of god-kings to ensure bountiful harvests, which Frazer traces through several cultures, including in his elaborations the myths of Adonis, Osiris, and Balder. While highly influential in its day, The Golden Bough has come under harsh critical scrutiny in subsequent decades, with many of its descriptions of regional folklore and legends deemed less than reliable. Furthermore, much of its tone is rooted in a philosophy of social Darwinism--sheer cultural imperialism, really--that finds its most explicit form in Frazer''s rhetorical question: "If in the most backward state of human society now known to us we find magic thus conspicuously present and religion conspicuously absent, may we not reasonably conjecture that the civilised races of the world have also at some period of their history passed through a similar intellectual phase?" (The truly civilized races, he goes on to say later, though not particularly loudly, are the ones whose minds evolve beyond religious belief to embrace the rational structures of scientific thought.) Frazer was much too genteel to state plainly that "primitive" races believe in magic because they are too stupid and backwards to know any better; instead he remarks that "a savage hardly conceives the distinction commonly drawn by more advanced peoples between the natural and the supernatural." And he certainly was not about to make explicit the logical extension of his theories--"that Christian legend, dogma, and ritual" (to quote Robert Graves''s summation of Frazer in The White Goddess) "are the refinement of a great body of primitive and barbarous beliefs." Whatever modern readers have come to think of the book, however, its historical significance and the eloquence with which Frazer attempts to develop what one might call a unifying theory of anthropology cannot be denied. --Ron Hogan','2nd, 3rd','Paperback','9.78019E+12',858,4.02,7141,'The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion: A New Abridgement','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1172153208l/143312.jpg','b3231',49.16),

    ('In a fresh, modern take on the remarkable Louisa May Alcott, Harriet Reisen''s vivid biography explores the author''s life in the context of her works, many of which are to some extent autobiographical. Although Alcott secretly wrote pulp fiction, harbored radical abolitionist views, and served as a Civil War nurse, her novels went on to sell more copies than those of Herman Melville and Henry James. Stories and details culled from Alcott''s journals, together with revealing letters to family, friends, and publishers, plus recollections of her famous contemporaries provide the basis for this lively account of the author''s classic rags-to-riches tale.

Writing with dazzling elegance and clarity, he retraces the steps that have led modern scientists from relativity and quantum mechanics to the notion of superstrings and the idea that our universe may coexist with others.But Weinberg asks as many questions as he answers, among them: Why does each explanation of the way nature works point to the other, deeper explanations? Why are the best theories not only logical but beautiful? And what implications will a final theory have for our philosophy and religious faith?Intellectually daring, rich in anecdote and aphorism, Dreams of a Final Theory launches us into a new cosmos and helps us make sense of what we find there.“This splendid book is as good reading about physics and physicists as this reviewer can name…clear, honest, and brilliantly instructive.”—Philip Morrison, Scientific American','First Vintage Books Edition','Paperback','9.78068E+12',340,4.02,2572,'Dreams of a Final Theory: The Scientist''s Search for the Ultimate Laws of Nature','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1435941554l/150129.jpg','b3263',49.83),
    ('A revised edition of the only book to explore the unique brilliance of director Tim Burton''s work, including a new chapter on the making of Sleepy Hollow.Still only in his thirties, Tim Burton has established himself in the past fifteen years as one of the great visionaries of film. With the Batman films, Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Ed Wood, and, most recently, Sleepy Hollow, he has continually broken new ground both visually and thematically, exploring the dark anguish--as well as the dark humor--that animates many of his characters while also creating a densely textured, sometimes bizarre look specific to each film. In Burton on Burton, Burton talks to Mark Salisbury about his training as an animator at Disney, the importance of design in his films, and the recurring themes present in his work. In this revised edition, he also discusses the influence of 1950s sci-fi and 1970s disaster films on Mars Attacks! as well as how he conceived his highly stylized approach to the content and setting of Sleepy Hollow, his acclaimed retelling of the Washington Irving story that stars Johnny Depp, perhaps the actor most identified with Burton''s work.

The physical sciences and engineering claim to be the basis of modern technology and therefore of modern life; the social sciences discuss big issues of governance, for example, democracy and taxation; the humanities claim that they revive your soul after it has been deadened by exposure to the physical and social sciences and to engineering.

You play games of strategy all the time: with your parents, siblings, friends, enemies, even with your professors. You have probably acquired a lot of instinctive expertise, and we hope you will recognize in what follows some of the lessons you have already learned.

    ('On February 1, 1922, the distinguished silent-film director William Desmond Taylor was shot to death in his Los Angeles bungalow by an unknown assailant. Reports of strange activities at the scene of the crime circulated soon after. When the police arrived, was the head of Paramount Studios burning a bundle of papers in the fireplace, and was a well-known actress searching the house for letters she claimed were hers? Despite a full-scale investigation, the case was never solved; for sixty years is has remained a lingering Hollywood scandal. 	In 1967, more than forty years after Taylor''s death, the great King Vidor, whose directing credits include Northwest Passage, The Fountainhead, Duel in the Sun, and War and Peace, determined to solve the mystery, which had haunted him throughout his career, in order to make a film about it. Through his intimate knowledge of both the studios and the stars, he succeeded, where dozens of professional detectives had failed, in discovering the identity of the murderer. But because his findings were so explosive, he decided he could never go public and locked his evidence away. 	After Vidor''s death in 1982, Sidney D.

    ('Fin dalle primissime battute di questa commedia al tempo stesso esilarante e feroce appare chiaro perché Roman Polanski abbia deciso di portarla sullo schermo – e perché attori come Isabelle Huppert, Ralph Fiennes e James Gandolfini abbiano voluto interpretarla a teatro. Poche volte, infatti, un autore è stato capace di squarciare con altrettanto soave crudeltà i veli destinati a ricoprire la costitutiva barbarie della creatura umana. Nel lindo, assennato salotto borghese in cui due coppie di genitori si incontrano per cercare di risolvere, da persone adulte e civili quali essi ritengono di essere, una questione in fondo di poco conto (una lite scoppiata ai giardinetti tra i rispettivi figli), vediamo sgretolarsi a poco a poco le maschere di benevolenza, tolleranza, buona creanza, e di correttezza politica, apertura mentale, dirittura morale; e sotto quelle maschere apparire il ghigno del nume efferato e oscuro che ci governa sin dalla notte dei tempi: il dio del massacro, appunto. Con uno humour corrosivo e una sorta di noncurante cinismo (e senza mai assumere il tono del moralista), in una lingua volutamente media, che sfodera tutto il suo micidiale potere, Yasmina Reza costruisce un brillante psicodramma, porgendo allo spettatore (e al lettore) uno specchio deformante nel quale scoprirà, non senza un acido imbarazzo, qualcosa che lo riguarda molto da vicino.','Piccola Biblioteca Adelphi #617','Paperback','9.78885E+12',91,3.82,3401,'Il dio del massacro','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327260871l/12742708.jpg','b3317',22.39),

Writing in a lyrical mixture of Spanish and English that is her unique heritage, she meditates on the condition of Chicanos in Anglo culture, women in Hispanic culture, and lesbians in the straight world.

Thirty years on from his first hit single, ''Space Oddity''. he remains the most influential rock star from the post-Woodstock generation - yet unlike Hendrix, the Beatles or even Prince, his life has never been the subject of a major biography. Strange Fascination chronicles Bowie''s career against the colourful backdrop of post-Beatles pop culture; of glam-era gender-bending, implausible substance abuse and sartorial silliness; 80s corporate sclock; 90s ''curator culture'' and laddish Britpop.

    ('Jane Austen began writing in her early teens, and filled three notebooks with her fiction. Her earliest work reflects her interest in the novel as a genre; in brilliant short pieces she plays with plots, stock characters, diction, and style, developing a sense of form at a remarkably early age. The characters of these stories have a jaunty and never-failing devotion to themselves. They perpetually lie, cheat, steal - and occasionally commit murder. Throughout these short or unfinished pieces, Austen exhibits her sense of the preposterous in life and fiction with tough-mindedness and robust humour. In her later published fiction, Austen had learned to take demands for propriety seriously, reining in whatever might be thought boisterous or coarse. Here we see Jane Austen without her inhibitions. In addition to prose fiction and prayers, this collection also contains many of Jane Austen''s poems, written to amuse or console friends, and rarely reprinted. Texts throughout are based on manuscripts, including the three notebooks, affording a distinct edition with a number of new readings.','Oxford World''s Classics','Paperback','9.78019E+12',372,3.76,641,'Catharine and Other Writings','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1374684663l/208829.jpg','b3331',27.53),

Το έργο κορυφώνεται με την εξέγερση του Στρατού και του Στόλου, το κίνημα του Απρίλη 1944 και τη δραματική καταστολή του, ενώ, με τον επίλογο του γ΄ τόμου, μεταφερόμαστε στη Θεσσαλονίκη μετά τον Εμφύλιο, το 1954, όπου ακούγεται ένα συγκλονιστικό ρέκβιεμ για τους χαμένους αγωνιστές.Ωστόσο, ο Τσίρκας δεν έγραψε χρονικό, αλλά έργο τέχνης.

    ('Kayla Davis è una donna “metropolitana”. Di New York ama tutto: il traffico, il caos, le folle. Nota per il suo sarcasmo e le sue relazioni mordi e fuggi, Kayla aspira a diventare un’affermata giornalista. Anche se al momento si accontenta di scrivere recensioni sui posti più alla moda della città. L’occasione di fare il salto arriva quando il suo capo decide di mandarla in una sperduta cittadina dell’Arkansas, per preparare un pezzo di rilievo nazionale su un argomento del tutto particolare... Kayla coglie al volo la proposta e, abbandonata l’amata New York, prova a inserirsi nella vita di Heber Springs. L’impatto non è dei migliori: le sue scarpe tacco dodici, preferibilmente blu elettrico, mal tollerano le polverose zone dell’America del Sud, il suo temperamento frenetico mal si adegua alla calma di un posto dove tutti si conoscono. Ma soprattutto, Kayla non pensava di dover fare i conti con la comparsa di Greyson Moir. Ce la farà Kayla a dimostrare quanto vale?

    ('Heaven Is a Playground was the first book on the uniquely American phenomenon of urban basketball. Rick Telander, a young photojournalist and former high school basketball player, spent part of the summer of 1973 and all of the summer of 1974 in Brooklyn living the playground life with his subjects at Foster Park in Flatbush. He slept on the floor of a park regular’s apartment, observing, questioning, traveling and playing with, and eventually coaching a ragtag group of local teenagers whose hopes of better lives were often fanatically attached to the transcendent game itself.At times little separates the author and his subjects, both of whom are emotionally linked by their passion for hoops. But as the summer unfolds and even superstars such as the legendary and incendiary Fly Williams are confronted with the realities of ghetto life and the sociological hurdles facing African American males, the joy of the game starts to be seen as the wispy pipe dream it often becomes. Written before cell phones, disposable cameras, and cable TV, Heaven Is a Playground is one of a kind—a funny, sad, ultimately inspiring book about Americans and the roots of the sport that they love.

    ('«Ho scritto questo libro per me stesso, e neppure di questo sono troppo sicuro. Per molto tempo sono state solo pagine sparse che rileggevo e forse correggevo convinto di non avere tempo. Ma tempo per cosa? Ero incapace di spiegarlo con precisione. Ho scritto questo libro per i fantasmi, che sono gli unici ad avere tempo perché sono fuori dal tempo». Anversa è il primo romanzo scritto da Bolaño («Naturalmente, non ho mai portato questo romanzo a una casa editrice») ed è anche l''ultimo pubblicato in vita. L''inizio e la fine, a distanza di vent''anni, di una storia di scrittore indipendente dalla cosiddetta letteratura ufficiale, diventato un riconosciuto innovatore, un autore di riferimento e un maestro, grazie alla chiarezza e la tristezza di un modo di scrivere il cui rischio principale è quello si usare la letteratura per cercare di ripetere un''esperienza del mondo, di fermare i vissuti propri e quindi, appunto perché irripetibili e mai del tutto decifrabili, aperti alla libertà di tutti di ammaliarsene e riviverli. E Anversa chiude, infatti, con una frase che è un impegno programmatico: «Come quei versi di Leopardi che Daniel Biga recitava su un ponte nordico per armarsi di coraggio, così sia la mia scrittura». Nello scheletro del romanzo, l''intreccio è un poliziesco: vi è un protagonista, da poco in Spagna, che lavora sulla Costa Brava, prima in un maneggio e poi in un camping dove ha luogo un delitto; e un ispettore di polizia e una ragazza con cui il poliziotto ha rapporti sessuali in cui giocano il ricatto e la perversione. Ma tutto è frantumato, ridotto in fotogrammi e visioni, incroci con altre trame e ricordi, con nuovi personaggi, su un piano visibilmente autobiografico. E tutti i temi che torneranno nei successivi romanzi di Bolaño, e soprattutto il suo maggiore, I detective selvaggi, sono presenti: l''anarchia, il girovagare per ricerche incongrue, il destino dei poeti, la tendenza figlia delle amate avanguardie e del surrealismo al bizzarro e al deforme quotidiano di corpi e situazioni.','La memoria #709','Paperback','9.78884E+12',152,3.6,2344,'Anversa','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1332008524l/9671564.jpg','b3396',8.55),

    ('The definitive biography of a larger-than-life president who defied norms, divided a nation, and changed Washington foreverAndrew Jackson, his intimate circle of friends, and his tumultuous times are at the heart of this remarkable book about the man who rose from nothing to create the modern presidency. Beloved and hated, venerated and reviled, Andrew Jackson was an orphan who fought his way to the pinnacle of power, bending the nation to his will in the cause of democracy. Jackson''s election in 1828 ushered in a new and lasting era in which the people, not distant elites, were the guiding force in American politics. Democracy made its stand in the Jackson years, and he gave voice to the hopes and the fears of a restless, changing nation facing challenging times at home and threats abroad. To tell the saga of Jackson''s presidency, acclaimed author Jon Meacham goes inside the Jackson White House. Drawing on newly discovered family letters and papers, he details the human drama-the family, the women, and the inner circle of advisers- that shaped Jackson''s private world through years of storm and victory.One of our most significant yet dimly recalled presidents, Jackson was a battle-hardened warrior, the founder of the Democratic Party, and the architect of the presidency as we know it. His story is one of violence, sex, courage, and tragedy. With his powerful persona, his evident bravery, and his mystical connection to the people, Jackson moved the White House from the periphery of government to the center of national action, articulating a vision of change that challenged entrenched interests to heed the popular will- or face his formidable wrath. The greatest of the presidents who have followed Jackson in the White House-from Lincoln to Theodore Roosevelt to FDR to Truman-have found inspiration in his example, and virtue in his vision.Jackson was the most contradictory of men. The architect of the removal of Indians from their native lands, he was warmly sentimental and risked everything to give more power to ordinary citizens. He was, in short, a lot like his country: alternately kind and vicious, brilliant and blind; and a man who fought a lifelong war to keep the republic safe-no matter what it took.','First edition','Hardcover','9.7814E+12',361,3.78,36794,'American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320480904l/3147367.jpg','b3480',46.29),

    ('A brilliant, provocative novel about an artist who, after years of being ignored by the art world, conducts an experiment: she conceals her female identity behind three male fronts.From the internationally bestselling author, praised for her "beguiling, lyrical prose" (The Sunday Times Review, UK), comes a brilliant, provocative novel about an artist, Harriet Burden, who after years of being ignored by the art world conducts an experiment: she conceals her female identity behind three male fronts. Presented as a collection of texts, edited and introduced by a scholar years after the artist''s death, the book unfolds through extracts from Burden''s notebooks and conflicting accounts from others about her life and work. Even after she steps forward to reveal herself as the force behind three solo shows, there are those who doubt she is responsible for the last exhibition, initially credited to the acclaimed artist Rune. No one doubts the two artists were involved with each other. According to Burden''s journals, she and Rune found themselves locked in a charged and dangerous psychological game that ended with the man''s bizarre death. From one of the most ambitious and internationally celebrated writers of her generation, Hustvedt''s The Blazing World is a polyphonic tour de force. It is also an intricately conceived, diabolical puzzle that addresses the shaping influences of prejudice, money, fame, and desire on what we see in one another. Emotionally intense, intellectually rigorous, ironic, and playful, this is a book you won''t be able to put down.','First Simon & Schuster hardcover edition','Hardcover','9.78148E+12',368,3.67,5827,'The Blazing World','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1418103958l/18143974.jpg','b3535',19.3);
